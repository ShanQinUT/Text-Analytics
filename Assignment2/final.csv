0,September 7,dino001,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out.  It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable.  Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person.  Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four""."
1,September 7,circlew,The lease rate is the factor that stops me cold from taking the leap.
2,September 8,qbrozen,"Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW."
3,September 9,FlightNurse2,Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?
4,September 9,roadburner,"Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car."
5,September 9,FlightNurse2,"Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers?  If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be  your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
6,September 9,roadburner,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."
7,September 9,dino001,"Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store.  It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer.  It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing,  not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those.  Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).  To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."
8,September 24,benjaminhf,"I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf. Just wanted to say I'm still alive, but my 17 year history with Edmunds has seemingly been erased. Also I've been very busy with work. But I wanted to briefly say that I'm still really enjoying the driving experience with my leased 2018 Acura TLX 2.4 Tech. Great car for the money imho. All best wishes out there to the chronic car buyers, etc."
9,September 24,stickguy,Still on the list.  Just have not been looking actively right now.
10,September 24,kyfdx,I sent you a message
11,September 26,benjaminhf,"A new and mostly positive review by Kelly Blue Book of the TLX. The reviewer says the TLX is likely to be more reliable than some other luxury cars in the long run, which is good news for me since I'm hoping to keep mine for quite a while...."
12,September 26,stickguy,If I do manage to upgrade to a TLX it would have to be with a 10 year horizon.
13,September 26,benjaminhf,Thanks. I'll give it a try at some point to merge my accounts.
14,September 26,benjaminhf,"I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty."
15,September 26,stickguy,They usually go up as the year goes along. Christmas ind Presidents’ Day are good options.
16,September 26,benjaminhf,"Yeah, I was and am a bit concerned with getting two new cars at once. But so far we haven't regretted it. The CR-V is also an awesome vehicle. We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
17,September 26,benjaminhf,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."
18,September 26,stickguy,"I like the 2 screen set up, for just the reason you said.  More real estate, and dedicated map when needed."
19,September 26,benjaminhf,"My local Cadillac dealer has their last ATS available for lease for $200 a month with ""0 down"":"
20,September 26,stickguy,I would take it.  without even looking at the link!
21,September 26,roadburner,That dealer has the same GM as my BMW dealer- the guy that ran off all but two of the BMW salespeople and added dealer packs and a high doc fee.
22,12:09AM,qbrozen,"The fine lrint for all says ""plus dealer add-ons."" Oh boy."
23,12:17AM,carnaught,The CTS looks like a smokin’n deal if your name is
24,12:46AM,stickguy,"so the car is $199/month, and the mop and glow stuff is another $175?"
25,2:19AM,roadburner,If I was 25 years older I might an XT5 as well.
26,2:22AM,qbrozen,"Its a hard knock life when 0-60 in 6.5 secs in an SUV is called ""a slug."""
27,August 7,benjaminh,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
28,August 8,andres3,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
29,August 8,benjaminh,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
30,August 8,sda,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
31,August 8,henryn,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."
32,August 8,roadburner,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.
33,August 8,Michaell,"May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?"
34,August 8,Mr_Shiftright,Funny...I just had this image of feeding vinyl records into the dashboard.
35,August 8,Michaell,"Oh, you mean like this?"
36,August 8,Mr_Shiftright,Yeah but the BIG ones.
37,August 8,Michaell,You asked for it …
38,August 8,Mr_Shiftright,"Oh, it even has a stacker.  This new technology will change everything."
39,August 8,ab348,"A new name, Shifty?"
40,August 8,Mr_Shiftright,A minor glitch we are working on . But it's still me
41,August 10,laurasdada,"I believe my XF has a 10gb hard drive, it allows me to upload 10 CDs.  So 10 on the HD, one in the player = the Spinal Tap nirvana of 11."
42,August 11,benjaminh,Another little feature I like on the TLX is the built-in compass....
43,August 12,sandman_6472,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!
44,August 12,sda,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
45,August 12,benjaminh,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."
46,August 13,andres3,"Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem."
47,August 13,stickguy,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
48,August 13,andres3,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
49,August 13,benjaminh,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.
50,August 13,stickguy,"Plus it’s not a lightweight, and us pushing an AWD system."
51,August 14,andres3,
52,August 26,flightnurse,So what is up with Edmunds these days? logging is a pain..
53,September 6,henryn,
54,September 7,circlew,Thinking about it....
55,September 7,qbrozen,"Stinger interests me, but not the horrible lease rates."
56,September 7,roadburner,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
57,July 27,benjaminh,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
58,July 27,benjaminh,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year."
59,July 27,andres3,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.  The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
60,July 27,benjaminh,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
61,July 27,benjaminh,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."
62,July 29,Mr_Shiftright,"I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me).   I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it."
63,July 29,benjaminh,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."
64,July 29,sda,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much.  Enjoy the pics, too.  Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX.  But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
65,July 30,benjaminh,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."
66,July 30,jpp5862,How many miles do you have on the TLX now?  After going on a couple of test rides with
67,July 30,benjaminh,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
68,July 30,jpp5862,That says a lot that you've driven it that much.   The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
69,July 31,sda,"I will buy another sedan at some point.  Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring,  TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO.  I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs.  A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have.  She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
70,July 31,benjaminh,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
71,August 1,henryn,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
72,August 1,sda,"I haven't ruled out the Passat.  I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own.  As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
73,August 2,andres3,I have an old friend that just testified to the following:
74,August 2,benjaminh,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but...."
75,August 2,ab348,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
76,August 2,benjaminh,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."
77,August 2,benjaminh,Declining sales last month for most ELL cars means bargains can be found....
78,August 3,laurasdada,Jag XE didn't even make the list; that can't be good...
79,August 3,benjaminh,"Probably a Jaguar is in a different category higher than ""entry-level luxury."" I just copied and pasted that list that someone compiled. I notice it's also missing the Cadillac ATS, I guess because the ATS is a little smaller?"
80,August 3,Mr_Shiftright,Jaguar XE sales are down considerably from 2017
81,August 4,benjaminh,"""Danger Will Robinson!"""
82,August 4,benjaminh,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX."
83,August 5,sda,"What classes do you teach?  I wonder if the standard audio in the TLX is better than the current Accord EXL+ models.  I do wish the standard TLX came with leather instead of faux leather. The higher seating position in the TLX, similar to my Accord is a plus.  I don't like the lower seating stance of the new Accord."
84,August 5,benjaminh,I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!
85,August 5,sda,"I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class.  When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors.  One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII.  The stories and insight that she shared, wow.  I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't."
86,August 5,benjaminh,A pic from today....
87,July 21,dino001,That's better than I can do in the relatively light weight 7-speed Optima with the 1.6T engine.  28.4 would be an improvement.  I'm gonna peg my lifetime average at 27 mpg.
88,July 21,flightnurse,My 320i would average 38 on the highway... The 4 cyl and ZF is a great match for Performance and MPG BTW my MPG was in Comfort mode
89,July 21,roadburner,"I get 30 mpg on my commute quite consistenly, as long as I keep light on the pedal and the traffic is average.  My best highway was nearly 40, going downhill from Atlanta to Tampa, but it drops quickly on any disturbance, or uphill.  It’s more like 35 on a typical trip."
90,July 22,Mr_Shiftright,"I don't what it is with some cars. My Mini gets 26 mpg, no matter what I do, or how I drive. 26 +/-  1."
91,July 22,benjaminh,You need a new car.
92,July 22,Mr_Shiftright,"Don't remind me. As usual, I'm hunting unicorns."
93,July 22,benjaminh,"Mpg on a trip from Louisville to Cincinnati and back in the TLX (c. 200 miles for the round trip). It was raining off and on both ways, sometimes heavily—and so AC, headlights, and wipers. Speed was c.65-75 mph."
94,July 23,henryn,"After owning that VW Passat TDI, no one will ever again impress me with MPG numbers.  Ain't gonna happen, sorry."
95,July 23,dino001,"It’s cool, as long as you don’t mind 40 times limit NOx emissions."
96,July 23,flightnurse,"I truly believe that for once, the EPA is underrating cars..."
97,July 23,flightnurse,Where is that Passat today?
98,July 23,henryn,"All true.  I never said they weren't cheating.  But man, when those German engineers cheat, they do a heck of a job!"
99,July 23,kyfdx,I’m really surprised that I haven’t seen more 2.0 diesels fixed and for sale.   Seems like there would be demand.
100,July 23,benjaminh,I think most of them are sitting unfixed in lots across the US....
101,July 23,benjaminh,"In addition to the pollution, the Passat's not an entry-level luxury car."
102,July 23,dino001,"I may not be, but it's nice.  I just drove a rental TDI in Scotland for a week and I didn't feel much deprived vs. my 430 GC.  The vehicle was a relative base (cloth seats, no Nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good.  Despite being FWD, it was nicely responsive, but I have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as I was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left).  Nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money.  Of course I didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 A4 TDI."
103,July 23,kyfdx,"Yes, buy why?"
104,July 23,andres3,"There's a good aftermarket tune for those old TDI's.  I experienced one in a loaner bug at my preferred shop.  Of course, it might be spewing 80X the current standard emissions now."
105,July 23,dino001,"I don't really understand the question, but I'm the last one to place some kind strict categories with a checklist.  People buy whatever they want and if they want to cross shop Escalade with Mazda Miata, it's weird, but it's their privilege.   All I just meant to say my dad's A4 TDI is loud (it's still in the family, my nephey has it) at highway speeds and you definitely know it's a downsized tractor engine with slightly better vibration dampening and noise insulation good enough for you hear the radio at somewhat loud setting.  Europeans liked those TDIs and Benz's old (slow, noisy and clunky) diesels long years before they bought into the ""diesel will save the planet and we just have it in our showroom"" lie, luxury or not."
106,July 27,benjaminh,Here are the kind of roads I get to enjoy driving on with my new TLX. Eat your hearts out city slickers. During the five minutes I was out of my car the road was completely empty in both directions.
107,July 27,Mr_Shiftright,Love that!  I was just up in the mountains on a similar road with the Mini--and I realized how old the suspension has gotten after many miles. This car is really tired--it just couldn't hold the line when pushed. It was like driving a skateboard.
108,July 27,Michaell,I'm hoping to take a couple of test drives over the weekend - 2015 TLX V6 w/ Tech. One FWD and the other AWD. Both priced around $25K.
109,July 27,henryn,I used to live out in the country and drive roads like that all the time.  Now I live in the inner city and drive highly congested pothole infested ...
110,July 27,kyfdx,"I live 4 miles from Downtown Cincinnati, and I can be on a road like that within 10 minutes."
111,July 27,ab348,Even nicer in a RWD performance car where you can use the throttle on/off to help yourself around the corners.
112,July 27,Michaell,"Sadly, most of the rural roads near me here in Colorado are dead straight."
113,July 27,roadburner,About 5 minutes for me...
114,July 27,qbrozen,Looks just like my town
115,July 27,brian125,"Growing up in NYC, Manhattan when I see a picture like this my thoughts are"
116,July 27,andres3,"i think you'd enjoy four-wheel DRIVING even more than steering.  Did you consider or test drive the TLX with SH-AWD?  I know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor.    Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD."
117,July 17,benjaminh,"Alex on Autos, on the other hand, thinks the TLX A-Spec awd is close in performance to an uplevel BMW or MB—and for a lot less."
118,July 17,stickguy,or buy it out at the end!
119,July 17,benjaminh,"My TLX already had almost 300 miles when I bought it. It had actually been traded with a dealer in TN at some point (I could tell from the window sticker). 300 miles is obviously small potatoes when compared with 36,000, but with a lease do they give you that credit so your actually mileage limit is 36,300 at the end of three years?"
120,July 17,kyfdx,
121,July 17,andres3,"I think I forgot to mention, why the hell is Acura putting GREEN X tires on a SH-AWD model (referring to KBB's review of a test model with those tires!?)?"
122,July 19,flightnurse,I have enjoyed listening to people takes on the Accord v TLX.. Interesting reading.
123,July 19,stickguy,"sorry to hear about your tranny issue.  Seems though that is a really rare occurence on a BMW, with the ZF?  I thought those were pretty bulletproof.  But, can always get a lemon anything.  The X2, will that replace the 330, or your other car (a 4 series?)"
124,July 19,qbrozen,So what happens at startup?
125,July 19,benjaminh,Somehow I hadn't heard of this before—but I'm glad I seemingly got it on the TLX.
126,July 19,qbrozen,"Not sure what 1/4 mile times you are looking at, but they are far from close. Of course, the Alfa costs a helluva lot more."
127,July 19,stickguy,Alfa: 11.8 seconds at 122 mph through the quarter-mile
128,July 19,flightnurse,"After the car sits for 12 hours And on start up the car lurches forward like it's not completely in natural. It doesn't make any noises like gears grinding, it has gotten worse in the 15 months I've had the car. Part of me says, screw it, I have less than 2 yrs left on the lease, the other half says, BMW knows there is a problem but they don't want to fix it."
129,July 19,flightnurse,I haven't read anyone issues like it mine with the ZF either on Bimmerfest or Bimmerpost. The ZF is a pretty build proof unit. The X2 will replace Ricks 328GT. He really liked the one I had as a loaner.
130,July 19,qbrozen,"also 1.1 secs, not a tenth."
131,July 19,flightnurse,"Ben in the BMW world, it was not unheard of getting a new BMW lease for 1% of MSRP, that was a good indicator that you got a good deal. When I was looking to replace my 320i, I was offered V6 TLXs for under 1%, reason, they weren't selling... Would you share your deal you got on your TLX?"
132,July 19,flightnurse,"You know the 1/4 miles times and trap speed means nothing today.  Most cars are going to be fast, fast enough to get you in trouble. My 330i will run the 1/4 in 13 sec's and about 100. 0-60 times in the high 5's (stock) drop a stage 1 onto (like I did) 0-60 in the mid 5 to low 5, and 1/4 times and speed goes up. We have a neighbor who has his new M5 w/comp package on order and all he talks about is how fast it goes. Some of us are betting that an accident will happen shortly after he gets it."
133,July 19,stickguy,"given the road quality and congestion around here, and the level of police interest, it quickly becomes all about bragging rights.  Not anything you can actually use (or in any realistic way need)."
134,July 19,flightnurse,YUP...
135,July 19,henryn,"I am forced to agree.  A 12 second quarter mile is an impressive thing, but I doubt I will ever again do that.  Or at least it would be a very rare occurrence.  But I do like acceleration."
136,July 19,qbrozen,My problem with the T&C is traction. One front tire powered by a 3.6 pulling 4800 lbs behind it results in nothing but wheelspin if you try to get going too quick.
137,July 19,benjaminh,"It's complicated because of my trade-in, but if somehow that could be taken out I'd be at less than 1% of msrp for my monthly payment."
138,July 19,Michaell,Figure roughly $30/mo for every $1000 of trade equity.
139,July 19,roadburner,"A 12.9 quarter mile is currently acceptable for me- until I finally install the M Performance locking differential- at that point I will probably bump the power up a bit, for more fun at HPDEs, the local drag strip, and the occasional stop light grand prix..."
140,July 20,benjaminh,"My new gas station mpg calculation for the 2018 TLX 2.4 was as follows: 345 miles/10.18 gallons=33.9 mpg. My car's trip computer says 34.1 mpg for those same miles, which is obviously very close. This was for about 70% highway miles. This is is beginning to seem like slightly higher mpg than for my 2016 Accord with the CVT—a car that weighs c.200 lbs less. Puzzled by this. Could it be the 8-speed dual clutch transmission? Is a DCT sometimes more efficient than a CVT?"
141,July 20,cdnpinhead,It's fun to watch people in love.
142,July 20,andres3,No mountain or canyon roads where you live?  Or nearby?
143,July 20,andres3,"I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground.    There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone."
144,July 20,flightnurse,"In the last 7 months my 330i has averaged 28.4, lets not forget that the last 3 months I've had the AC running all the time, the best highway was on a trip to Austin TX, 37 MPG, I really don't think this is bad for a car that can run mid-to low 5 0-60."
145,July 20,benjaminh,According to this article....
146,July 21,andres3,That's better than I can do in the relatively light weight 7-speed Optima with the 1.6T engine.  28.4 would be an improvement.  I'm gonna peg my lifetime average at 27 mpg.
147,July 13,stickguy,"He certainly seems To be quite picky.  And if you want a 200k Porsche, buy one!"
148,July 13,benjaminh,
149,July 13,benjaminh,"Today I went with my TLX and my folding bike to a park on the outskirts of town called—believe it or not—Pope Lick Park. About a 20 minute drive each way, 60-70 mph on the highway, and then some two lane roads. Got about 35 mpg on the little trip with ac on the whole way, which seemed pretty good. We have good parks here in Louisville, and some have very nice bike paths. In fact, I think the ""Louisville Loop"" in its various places is one of the better urban/rural bike paths in the country. Anyway, here's one of my uses of my entry-level luxury sedan for today—and in the last pic you can see my ugly mug to see the face of the guy who has been bothering you off and on for almost 20 years here. By the way, the volume dial on the steering wheel of the TLX has been copied for the 2018 Accord. But having driven both, I can say that although they look almost the same the Accord's is a cheap feeling piece of hard plastic, while the TLX's is a rubberized dial that feels and works better."
150,July 13,ab348,Sure thing. Most of these were taken shortly after delivery.
151,July 13,kyfdx,I love the interior...   looks like you are missing a pedal.
152,July 13,benjaminh,
153,July 13,benjaminh,"Hope some other ""entry level luxury-sport"" owners will share their pix too.++"
154,July 13,qbrozen,"If its the 3.6, it should be way better than 6.5. I think it may be the 2.0T, unless I'm getting my ATS owners mixed up."
155,July 13,pensfan83,I love the red...it goes so good with the interior colors.
156,July 13,ab348,"Mine is a RWD ""Premium Performance"" with the 3.6. The 0-60 time is supposedly mid-5s. All I know is that it is really quick, especially in the midrange. Haven't bothered with gas mileage calculations yet. I haven't done a lot of highway driving with it so the computer numbers it displays would likely be pretty dismal (I haven't looked at it recently). It is just a super-fun car to drive. I wish the interior had a little less black and a little more Kona Brown, but I'm glad it isn't all black."
157,July 13,benjaminh,"My mpg on my big commute to get my son—Louisville to Lexington and back—was one of my excuses for getting the new TLX. I thought I'd take a significant mpg hit for moving from an Accord to an Acura, but if the mpg meter on the new TLX is accurate the mpg is very similar. I got c.36 mpg on the way over and c.38 mpg on the way back. This is a c.80 mile drive with AC on going c.70-75 mph. I know I'm getting premium gas instead of regular, but I'm still impressed that mpg is the same as a CVT car that weighs c.200 lbs less...."
158,July 14,benjaminh,
159,July 14,benjaminh,"With still more than half a tank of gas in my new TLX curiosity got the better of me on the mpg front, and I decided to fill it up so that I could do a manual calculation to check against the car's trip calculator. I drove 225 miles with 6.4 gallons, which gives an average of 35.15 mpg for c. 85% highway driving—which is quite good. The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33."
160,July 14,cdnpinhead,"I can tell you that my TSX mpg computer averages about 5% high over 142K miles, quite consistently.  Every other readout that I can check (speed, miles, temp, etc.) are dead on.  It never reads low, just varying degrees of high.  The marketing guys won this one -- a tiny percentage of people hand-calculate MPG."
161,July 14,roadburner,"On some BMWs you can get into a service menu that lets you adjust the OBC mpg calculation. Funny thing, every BMW I've owned with an OBC has tended to be 5% optimistic. Ditto for the Mini. However, the 2 Series OBC is usually 8%"
162,July 15,benjaminh,"Brought the folding bike in my TLX to another nice park today. The twisty rural roads are fun even when following the speed limit (which I pretty much did). The auto-dimming mirror in this car has a rather thin frame. The Acura Link button lets you call a concierge for restaurant recommendations and reservations, theater/concert tix, etc, and I'm subscribed to it for free for a certain number of months—I forget how many. I think I need to take a trip and use it. The other button is similar to an Onstar emergency button, I guess. My Honda Accord didn't have either of these buttons. Below a few pix of the strangely idyllic bike paths around Louisville. Being from California, I still marvel at the lack of crowds in some places here even after 20 years...."
163,July 15,benjaminh,TLX pix—engine compartment edition.
164,July 15,sda,The TLX is certainly dressed up under hood.  You got my curiosity about the radiator fans.  The Accord has two as well. They look very similar overall.
165,July 15,ab348,"To take my mind off other events, I got some pics of the ATS engine and trunk compartment today."
166,July 15,cdnpinhead,"Haven't you heard?  Almost no one looks under the hood in the daylight these days, let alone at night.  That's part of how BMW got away with eliminating the dipstick lo these many years ago."
167,July 15,benjaminh,Wait—you mean you can't manually check your oil level with new BMWs??
168,July 15,dino001,That’s correct.
169,July 15,qbrozen,"Oh, you can manually check. You manually push some sequence of buttons and a level appears in the cluster that ""estimates"" how much oil you have. At least, that was the case in my 2008, so I'm assuming that is still the case."
170,July 16,roadburner,"They've improved the sensors quite a bit on the Fxx and Gxx cars. I'd prefer to have a dipstick as a backup, but on the newer cars I'm comfortable with the sensor."
171,July 16,benjaminh,"Before I had it, I thought ""rain sensing wipers"" fell in the realms of unneeded and even silly features. But yesterday driving my son c. 80 miles in traffic with variable rain conditions the darn thing worked pretty well. Not worrying about how fast to put the windshield wipers on made it slightly easier to carry on a conversation and worry about the other aspects of driving. Obviously not an essential feature, but it can actually be useful imho."
172,July 16,benjaminh,
173,July 16,benjaminh,Alex on Autos likes the performance of the A-Spec TLX....
174,July 16,ab348,"It is an absolute gas to drive. Much faster than any car I've ever owned so I need to watch myself. The handling is something else too, as it has far more capability in that department than I am used to using."
175,July 16,henryn,"I have a good friend who owns a late model Cadillac SRX, I disremember the year (2016? 2017? Whatever.)"
176,July 16,andres3,"I think that KBB review is ""fair.""  The TLX just isn't a real sports sedan.  If you bought one thinking you'll go canyon carving with your BMW and Audi friends, you may be disappointed.   If you got one thinking you got the better Accord, chances are you'll be happy."
177,July 11,stickguy,cute ad.  and the new Forte is a nice looking car!
178,July 11,cdnpinhead,"I'm fairly confident that the majority of people driving cars today couldn't tell the difference if only one wheel were driven, never mind on which axle."
179,July 11,Mr_Shiftright,"Once in a while we've actually had that question in Forums: ""How can I tell if my car is FWD or RWD?"""
180,July 11,qbrozen,"considering how many damned cars have black interiors, I'm pretty sure even that is not a prerequisite."
181,July 12,Mr_Shiftright,
182,July 12,roadburner,It
183,July 12,Mr_Shiftright,"No excuse for this, really. It has enough HP to be entertaining."
184,July 12,stickguy,sounds like something I might like.  Sucker for hatches of this style.  I can take my chances with a 14 second quarter.  Super comfy seats are a big plus.
185,July 12,ab348,"I do not find it attractive at all. The previous version was far better looking IMO, and inside, this one is not good at all. As a GM fan this car is a huge disappointment. Top that off with performance that is mid-pack at best and I suspect the model may not make it to the end of its 4-year production contract with PSA at the former GM plant in Russelsheim, at least for North American markets."
186,July 12,benjaminh,"After a week apart I got to drive my new TLX for more than an hour today, all in Sport mode, which is the way to go for the 2.4. One highway run of c.70 mph with AC had a car calculated 36.5 mpg. If that's not a fluke, and if the car's mpg calculator is accurate (the one on my Accord was) then the highway mpg is very close to what I got in the 2016 Accord. Still finding all sorts of little quality touches, such as the nice feeling carpet, and the hidden storage area in the trunk (no spare tire, just fix a flat). I'd rather have a tire, I think, but the honest truth is that I haven't changed a tire since about 1995. Since then I've always let AAA do it, or tow it, and I haven't had any regrets."
187,July 12,henryn,"It has been several years since I last used a spare tire.  And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan.  I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was.  My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours."
188,July 12,stickguy,"Henry, I am with you.  No spare tire is a hot button issue.  Last blow out I had was at night, on a holiday, in the middle of nowhere.  At least with the donut on I could get to a hotel, then next day find a tire store.  The tire was shredded so yeah, no can of fix a flat was helping."
189,July 12,benjaminh,
190,July 12,Michaell,I noticed the lack of a spare tire on my test drive of the CPO 2015 TLX last weekend. I'm very much on the fence about this issue.
191,July 12,stickguy,the plastic insert should pop out.  I know for sure in the ILX it did.
192,July 12,benjaminh,"Almost everything about the TLX seems to be significantly higher in quality than an Accord, and often that higher quality comes with some added weight. I assume some designers several years ago said, more or less: here's a way we can save c.40 pounds all at once. And how many people really change their own tires at this point?"
193,July 13,sda,"Keep the comparison review of the Accord/TLX/CR-V coming!   Speaking of which, do you find the TLX to be significantly quieter than the Accord and how so?  I do believe you can run regular gas without damage in the TLX without too much performance degradation...if Premium gas is recommended and not required."
194,July 13,stickguy,"Premium is recommended in my RDX too, but runs fine on regular.  The engine is identical best as I can tell to the Pilot, Accord, etc.  I think it even has the same code designation.  Same compression ratio, even same power output.  The TLX, not sure how much different it is than the Accord motor.  Odds are it is fine on regular but might cut performance slightly but only at higher revs."
195,July 13,stickguy,"with tires, it is not just a matter of not wanting to change your own.  You can still call AAA.  The difference is, if you have a spare, they put it on and you are on your way.  No spare, and you are riding in the front seat of a tow truck, or standing on the side of the road waiting for an Uber, while you hope that the tow truck drops your car someplace that can find a tire right away.  Just hope you don't get a flat when they are closed!"
196,July 13,kyfdx,"My wife's car doesn't have a spare..  or, the one before this one..     Since 2013, no issues."
197,July 13,benjaminh,"Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much."
198,July 13,stickguy,"I am planning to stop at the Acura dealer Saturday afternoon, for their ""summer event"".  Free lunch and a test drive, what's not to love?  Will give the wife a chance to scope and (and hopefully drive) an RDX, and will also spend some time in a TLX too (won't need to drive that one)."
199,July 13,benjaminh,"That new 2019 RDX really is a knock out. But you'll pay a lot at this point for one, unless you're getting the base model. One big advantage of the TLX, as I know I've already said in some detail, is that you can potentially lease one for significantly less than a comparable Accord."
200,July 13,roadburner,No spare in the i3 or 2er; the ti has a spare that has never been used in the 23 years I've owned the car.
201,July 13,stickguy,"oh, we would not be buying one now.  Just deciding if we want to put it on the wish list and plan around it.  I would be quite happy with a much more affordable TLX too."
202,July 13,henryn,"My worst tire changing experience was on my 2000 F250 diesel, the one I used to pull the 5th wheel travel trailer.  I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go.  This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually.  The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep.   That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack.  I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did.  Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack."
203,July 13,benjaminh,"Yeah, stuff like this is why I'm never going to bother with changing a tire ever again."
204,July 13,stickguy,I would prefer not to either.  The AAA guy can do that.  Just have to have the tire on hand to put on!
205,July 13,benjaminh,"I'll just live on the wild side when it comes to spare tires (or lack) and see what happens. No doubt I'll let you know and cry uncle if somehow disaster strikes.  But my guess is that the odds of a flat are low on the roads I drive. My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho. Other things being equal I'd take a spare, but given how much I like almost everything else about the TLX I doubt I'll miss it much. Again, we'll see. I might end up eating my words...."
206,July 13,ab348,Interesting link from KBB that popped up in my online reading this AM. Long-term evaluation notes about their TLX:
207,July 8,henryn,"I'm not about to argue against what you're saying, basically I agree with you.  But...  what exactly does that say about anyone who buys a used Mercedes or BMW or Audi or  ..."
208,July 9,roadburner,"All but two of my 11 BMWs were purchased used, and only four were CPO cars. I always pay them off within 2-3 years and keep them for 8-10 years at a minimum. So far I have no regrets on any of my purchases- although the E90 328i was not exactly exciting and was offloaded to my son. As a point of comparison my Mazdaspeed 3 needed several repairs under warranty and I eventually needed to replace most of the suspension components, but like my BMWs, the pleasure the car gave me outweighed those issues."
209,July 9,Michaell,
210,July 9,stickguy,interesting.  Even more so in a couple years when they are CPO at half the price
211,July 9,Michaell,"Yeah, I noticed that was conspicuously omitted from the article. These are going to make some great buys, used. I don't think they'll get modded, unlike the STi or Type R."
212,July 10,roadburner,"The Stinger is still too big for my tastes- and all the idiot dealers in my area only stock GT2 cars with AWD, pandering to the nitwits that think RWD is tantamount to a death sentence on anything other than straight and level dry pavement. I did see a Stinger in the wild today; I think it looks worse in person..."
213,July 10,benjaminh,"Tried to figure out how much it would be to get an Audi A4 with about the same level of equipment as my TLX Tech. The number I came up with was c.46k for the Audi A4 with leather, navi, upgraded sound system, etc.—about 9k more than the TLX."
214,July 10,stickguy,you do gain some HP in the deal though.   and AWD (assuming you are looking at a Quattro).
215,July 10,benjaminh,Audi A4 Ultra Prestige FWD.
216,July 10,stickguy,"Ah,  a FWD.  always seems odd to see one of these at an Audi dealer.  And Audi prices.  Forget the extra HP.  that one is detuned.  But, at least I think they did away with the CVT.  I would get a much cheaper TLX instead."
217,July 10,henryn,"Everybody keeps saying that, so much so that I am beginning to have doubts.  If everyone wants a clean used 2 year old Stinger, then supply and demand will kick in, and the price will go up.  Way up."
218,July 10,andres3,"Did you see the fuel economy on that model though?  I can vouch that Audi knows how to do FWD as well as anyone, including Honda."
219,July 10,circlew,
220,July 10,iluvmysephia1,I think the Stinger is too big and it's also too expensive for me. The 2019 Kia Forte is soon ta be out and Kia fans are saying it looks sorta like a baby Kia Stinger. The 2019 Kia Forte 6-speed stick would work out good for the Mrs. and I some day.
221,July 10,benjaminh,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car."
222,July 10,andres3,"I think you hit the nail on the head.  The gadgets and whiz bang bells and whistles keep increasing, but the underlying quality seems to be going the other way; especially in the better ""lower-end"" makes.  Lots of things are being compromised to hit price points while adding the latest nanny features."
223,July 10,qbrozen,"Just read a comparison of Accord 2.0T sport. $36k?! Sign me up for a Stinger instead, please!"
224,July 10,andres3,Can you get a V6 Stinger for $36K though?  Maybe with discounts?  Would you really want a 2.0T Stinger?
225,July 10,Michaell,2.0T Sport at $36K? You sure that wasn't a Touring?
226,July 10,qbrozen,"That's the fair comparison to the 2.0T Accord, however."
227,July 10,qbrozen,For a base cloth model. Stinger starts with leather and can be had for $30k.
228,July 10,andres3,"That's the fair comparison to the 2.0T Accord, however."
229,July 10,qbrozen,"Yes, definitey. Yet I don't think many Accord/Camry shoppers are doing that. I just wonder why. Is it  a badge problem or not knowing it even exists?"
230,July 10,Michaell,"I think to most folks, RWD = bad, FWD = good."
231,July 10,qbrozen,"But how many people do you think even know that? I'd be willing to bet if you asked 100 random shmoes, maybe one of them would know it is RWD."
232,July 10,stickguy,I have a theory that 90% of CUV owners would have no clue if they had FWD instead of AWD. I guarantee my wife wouldn’t.
233,July 10,Michaell,"But how many people do you think even know that? I'd be willing to bet if you asked 100 random shmoes, maybe one of them would know it is RWD."
234,July 10,stickguy,"well, Toyota does stuff like that with a Camry."
235,July 11,andres3,"But how many people do you think even know that? I'd be willing to bet if you asked 100 random shmoes, maybe one of them would know it is RWD."
236,July 11,Mr_Shiftright,Found it!
237,June 24,stickguy,"so close to $400 including tax, putting down the DMV fees.  Not a screaming bargain."
238,June 24,henryn,"0-60 in 5 seconds flat, not too shabby.  Not super car level, but far from slow."
239,June 24,kyfdx,"That is a RWD base model, not a GT"
240,June 24,roadburner,The only one that interests me is the RWD GT2; there aren't any in my neck of the woods. I'd still probably end up with a Giulia Ti instead if I was straying from the Munich fold.
241,June 24,qbrozen,
242,July 6,benjaminh,"This thread seems quiet lately, but finally I'm now an actual member in good standing."
243,July 6,benjaminh,"Moving from an Accord to a TLX prevents one tiny problem (which is pretty meaningless)—""meeting"" your exact car at an intersection or on the road. My wife and I made a joke of it, but several times we'd see a white Accord that looked just like mine, or a red Accord that looked just lke hers. Once I was at a four-way stop sign and there were four Accords of different colors and generations there all at once. Now that I'm an Acura owner I do notice Acuras more, but usually they're RDXs, MDXs, and earlier Acura sedans. There are definitely TLXs on the road, but seeing one is pretty rare."
244,July 6,stickguy,"The entire category is slumping. Only Audi is up.  At least the S60 is being replaced this year, giving that tiny number some justification."
245,July 6,brian125,If I was about 25 pounds lighter and 3 inches shorter  I'd buy  the Audi A/S4.  I really like them.   I don't see any TLX's here in SC or NYC area . What I have noticed was a lot of Q50's ( good leases ) and MDX's in NY the last year or so.
246,July 6,brian125,benjaminh
247,July 6,flightnurse,The S60 and 3 Series are new for 2019. and I think Volvo has a hit on its hand with the new S60/V60.
248,July 6,stickguy,I liked what I saw and read about on it. Hope it is as nice in person.
249,July 6,benjaminh,"Huge difference. Wish I'd done it before. Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho."
250,July 6,brian125,Sounds like a nice upgrade to a Accord.  Next time I'm at Acura dealer I will test drive one. Acura's sound system is one of the best systems. Lots of luck with your new ride!
251,July 6,henryn,"I have never been in an Acura dealership.  I've never driven one, and offhand I can't recall ever riding in one.  I know a couple of people who own one of their SUVs, but I've never happened to ride with them."
252,July 6,flightnurse,
253,July 6,qbrozen,I'm liking the XC40 more and more as I see the commercials and them in the wild. Saw one today that was in a kind if orangey-red. Really sharp.
254,July 6,flightnurse,There is a lot of room in them
255,July 7,stickguy,"I liked the one that I saw at the car show.  One of these days I will find an excuse to be out running errands near the Volvo dealer, and just stop in to browse."
256,July 7,andres3,"If you want rare, get an RLX!  I saw one out in the wild today, probably the first of 2018!"
257,July 7,andres3,"Just curious, do you remember if the A5 was FWD or quattro?  The other thing that wouldn't surprise me is if they put low octane fuel in a high octane competitor."
258,July 7,andres3,"Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here."
259,July 7,flightnurse,"It was Quartto, no sport package, it handled very poorly."
260,July 7,stickguy,"It seems counter intuitive, but it seems that some of the premium/luxury brands are still more problematic than mainstream, cheaper ones.  To me, if I am paying top dollar, one of the things I expect is a well designed and built car, that should need nothing but routine maintenance.  Just like my Hyundais have been!  I would rather not even care how the service department experience is, since I only go once a year and it takes an hour or less."
261,July 7,kyfdx,"The top makes for reliability are perennially, Honda and Toyota."
262,July 7,benjaminh,But I assume that means Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus....?
263,July 7,andres3,How reliable has your son's Audi been?
264,July 7,andres3,The S4 8 years ago achieved 4.9.  So there's that.
265,July 7,Mr_Shiftright,"That's not what they are built for--the expensive cars are generally leased or traded in after a few years, and certainly during warranty.  They are made for people who want the latest in luxury and gadgetry, and a few years, want the NEW latest in luxury and gadgetry."
266,July 7,stickguy,no issues.  I don't think it has been back to the dealer for other than routine service.  And a couple of busted tires!
267,February 7,Michaell,"Kia has changed up the calculus of their lease programs - high MF, low residual but high lease cash."
268,February 7,flightnurse,Is lease cash depended on location?
269,February 7,roadburner,I think the Alfa situation is also a bit different; it's a classic European brand that I think can do well if they iron out the QC issues and reliability is decent.
270,February 7,qbrozen,"Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here."
271,February 7,Michaell,"For the Stinger, the numbers are national."
272,February 7,flightnurse,I'm not aware that Alfa has had major quality issues with its cars lately.
273,February 7,flightnurse,So why is it 4800 to 7200?
274,February 7,kyfdx,Depending on trim and drive
275,February 7,kyfdx,"A lot more Stinger lease info can be found, here:"
276,June 20,henryn,This thread has been dead for a while.  Did anyone ever actually buy a Stinger?  Inquiring minds want to know.
277,June 20,stickguy,I think I saw one out on the road so far. Maybe.
278,June 20,roadburner,I'd consider a RWD GT2 once depreciation has knocked the price down to a reasonable level. For what one would cost new I'd rather have a CPO F80 M3 or F82 M4- or a Mustang Bullitt for that matter.
279,June 20,kyfdx,"The Kia is fast and relatively large..    If you value size in a vehicle, that's great.   But, I'd take the Alfa over it, in that price range."
280,June 20,roadburner,Me too. I do like the Giulia TI as well as the Stelvio TI.
281,June 20,carnaught,
282,June 20,kyfdx,"I wouldn't buy a Stinger, for the same reason as the Alfa.    The"
283,June 20,roadburner,"As I said, a RWD GT2 may well be a screaming bargain after the massive depreciation hit."
284,June 20,ab348,It seems like auto journos were the main group that were in love with the Stinger. And they don't buy them.
285,June 20,Mr_Shiftright,"This Jalopnik article has an interesting angle on the ""Kia problem""."
286,June 20,dino001,"This article is describing exactly what I think will be largest problems for Stingers and any other model over 40 grand.  It's not even about the technology, as luxury dealers are sometimes behind on that, too (they were last ones to have their inventory posted online), but the attitude of ""you must buy it today"" that simply doesn't work for people who know they can afford a car twice as expensive, if they wanted to.  All I need is to see the commercials of Kia dealers from my area and I know I don't want to go there.  If they keep the Stinger around I still may need to bite the bullet and go to check it out for my next car.  I get cold sweat even thinking about it."
287,June 20,flightnurse,"Kia had a ""Stinger Experience"" here in Phoenix 2 months back and Rick and I went. It was very interesting they had 3 Kia Stinger GT RWD and 3 with AWD. They also had a BMW 640i GC, Audi A5, Porsche Panamera and another car I can't remember. You drive the ""other"" car first around a road course, then you pick a GT to drive, there are three laps, the last lap was driven by one of the ""Professional"" drivers. I got the Audi A5 and it was a dog, Rick got the 640 and loved it."
288,June 20,flightnurse,"Then don't buy a Kia, but a Genesis G70 with a manual."
289,June 21,dino001,Does it have a hatch?
290,June 21,stickguy,nope.  Small 4 door sedan.  Bummer.
291,June 21,dino001,"I knew that.  It was rethorical.  I said here that Stinger belonged to Genesis line IMHO, not Kia."
292,June 23,circlew,Lease offer on GT 36 months. Tempting.
293,June 24,henryn,"^^^ There are a great many cars out there which have the 2 letters ""GT"" as part of their nomenclature.  Which one exactly are you referring to here???"
294,June 24,circlew,Stinger GT in NJ
295,June 24,qbrozen,"Wonder what the rest of the details are, such as MF and residual."
296,June 24,flightnurse,$299/month  2.0 RWD
297,February 4,stickguy,should be the GT version though to get the hatch.  Or was that what you meant?
298,February 4,Mr_Shiftright,"I just priced out a Ford F-150 Platinum, heavy on options, and I'm already up to $72,900.  Sure does have everything, though."
299,February 4,flightnurse,"Nope I built a 330i sedan.  I looked at what the article compared, I think that is the only fair way to go about it, some people on Bimmerfest think the Stinger should be compared to the 5 series because it's close in wheelbase. But if Kia talks about the 3 series then compare it to the 3 series."
300,February 4,qbrozen,"I also, as I have stated before, think the Stinger is closer to the 5-series. No idea why Kia says anything about the 3'er, unless it is only because that is the standard all the mags use."
301,February 4,flightnurse,Why do you think it needs to go against a 5 series? Size?  I think Kia wants the 3 series because of the price.
302,February 4,qbrozen,"Not sure where we made the comparison before, but yes, because of its size. Comparing on price does not make sense to me. You can get an Escalade and 911 for the same price, so does that mean they are comparable?"
303,February 4,stickguy,"the comparison tests have all been versus the 3, A5, etc.  even if the WB is a little longer, it doesn't really compete against the cars in the E/5 series class.   Seems like it has always been that way though."
304,February 4,flightnurse,"They still make the 3GT, the issue really is, the 3GT only comes in xDrive while the Stinger can be had in RWD and AWD. Which I don't think is a proper comparison."
305,February 4,stickguy,"well, in the north east, the 3 series effectively only comes as Xdrive.  You will never find a RWD on the lot.  I am guessing that Kia will likely be the same."
306,February 4,qbrozen,"Here is what I posted on the previous page. In terms of interior room, especially rear seat space, the 5 and the Stinger are a virtual tie. In all measurements, it is clear that it is closer to the 5 than the 3."
307,February 4,flightnurse,"This because the dealer won't order them, but you can get RWD cars you just have to order them."
308,February 5,dino001,"The idea of going against 3 rather than 5 is to advertise „it’s bigger, has more power, more stuff and it’s cheaper”.  Going against bigger 5 series that has many more available features (even if optional) would make it rather unsubstantiated in eyes of people who are silling to spend north if 60 grand, even uf couple metrics match.  Just like the CTS might have been 5er size, it was crossed shopped by 3-series buyers, no matter what Cadillac’s marketng department tried to sell."
309,February 5,dino001,"That may be true where you live, not so much here.  So all you need is to get on a plane, or order."
310,February 5,qbrozen,"On the other hand, it could be judged heavier and less dynamic than the 3'er yet hold its own or be better than the 5'er in those areas. Also, of course, WAY cheaper than a comparable 5."
311,February 5,dino001,I think less than 5 percent of buyers look at curb weight and less tham fifth of those would make it a decision issue.
312,February 5,qbrozen,"Yes, but I think many sports sedan buyers ""feel"" the weight."
313,February 5,dino001,"With current engines, weight is much less an issue than it was 20 or even 10 years ago."
314,February 5,stickguy,BMW certainly keeps porking up.   only so much you can do to overcome physics.
315,February 5,andres3,"so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue?"
316,February 5,andres3,"Tires and brake pads will complain about weight by making you run out of them sooner and faster.  The tires on my lighter TTS are holding up well, though I am planning to get new PS4's soon."
317,February 5,roadburner,"My 2er weighs about the same as my 1988 M6, which was about 1.5 feet longer. The M6 had a Dinan chip and no cat so it was fairly quick for its day, but certainly not as fast as the 2 Series. That said, the M6 had timeless style and a incredibly cool exhaust note."
318,February 6,flightnurse,"Oh, my do we have a new entry into the ELLPS?"
319,February 6,stickguy,Like the idea.  Nice styling.  Dash looks hideous.
320,February 6,Mr_Shiftright,Looks like one of those Dyson vacuum cleaners. That's not a luxury look--that's GEE-GAW.
321,February 6,flightnurse,"I like the dash, it's different, and I'm sure that is what will be coming in the future."
322,February 7,coldinohio,"based on my brief drive of the Stinger GT2, Kia will have to up its game to play with the  Audi /BMW / MB crowd; and having a $3500  regional markup is a non-starter"
323,February 7,Michaell,Soooo .... here's a thought.
324,February 7,kyfdx,"The lease penetration is pretty high at those price points.    And, the Stinger lease program sucks."
325,February 7,stickguy,"Yes, I think newbies are the focus. And current hyunkia owners that want to get fancier.  And of course people that can’t afford the name brands.  Not seeing a lot of diehards or brand snobs making the switch."
326,February 7,flightnurse,"I know the Residual is like 50% and the MF isn't that good, but doesn't Kia have 6700 lease cash? Alfa had the same issue with the Gulita when it first came out, but they lease programs have gotten better."
327,January 21,qbrozen,"Having a bit of trouble with passenger volumes of the BMWs, but here is what I was able to dig up. Interestingly, the 3'er has more front leg room than the 5'er. Stinger trumps both. Rear leg room is within a tenth of an inch between the 5'er and Stinger."
328,January 22,roadburner,"They are all a bit too big and heavy for my tastes, although I did enjoy a 440i GC M Sport we had in our loaner fleet. RWD and the M Performance Power and Sound kit made it a lot of fun despite being a bit porky..."
329,January 22,andres3,"I've heard too many happy BMW owners over too many years and too many car models praise the in-line 6 engines, that to get a BMW without one would be sacrilegious to me."
330,January 22,dino001,"I was one, yet I have a four-cylinder now and think it's quite alright."
331,January 22,Mr_Shiftright,"The BMW is a car, not a church (although some might contest that)"
332,January 22,kyfdx,"Ditto..     Of course, the last n/a 6 cylinder helped push me that way.  It was uninspiring."
333,January 22,dino001,"The N/A straight six had a great sound.  Beautiful, I loved it.  But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s.  My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability.  Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers.  Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far.  We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six.  Those four cylinders are still building the record.  One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines.  Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."
334,January 26,flightnurse,"Dino the N20/26 engine had a timing chain issue that BMW has FINALLY recognized and have increased the factory warranty, other than that the N series engine seems to be pretty built proof. The new B series engines are too new but would think they are just as built proof. The mileage for the F3X series cars have exceeded the EPA #, on a trip to Santa Fe, I averaged 37, Rick got 36 going to Austin in his GT."
335,February 2,flightnurse,"Comparison test of an Audi A4, BMW 430 GC xDrive and Kia Stinger AWD"
336,February 2,Mr_Shiftright,Ha! I was just going to post that.  Kia takes on the big boys. The Stinger isn't perfect but look at the price differential!
337,February 2,stickguy,I read that article in the magazine.  Seems like BMW took the hit there.  Audi romped.
338,February 2,andres3,"They really did like the A5 Sportback.  What amazes me, is the A4 is significantly lighter than the A5 Sportback, and is essentially the same car.   The sportback might be tuned a bit more aggressively suspension-wise though than the ""family"" sedan."
339,February 2,flightnurse,"I posted this over on Bimmerfest and of course, many people are bitching that the 430i xDrive didn't have the ""right"" suspension. Of course, not too sure what they mean by that since you can't get xDrive with the 704 suspensions. But the price is a whopping 14K difference, is Audi worth it?"
340,February 2,andres3,"Based on Car & Driver's review and my bias, I'd say so."
341,February 2,andres3,
342,February 2,dino001,"Not sure if 430ix standard suspension is same as my one in my RWD 430i (I have a std., not M-sport, not adaptive M-sport).  Anyway, I don't care what C&D says about 430 ix GC steering and suspension.  It's good enough for me.  Perhaps I'm getting older.  On my next round of vehicles I may be out of ELLPS altogether and into stupid SUVs.  Ugh.  Or maybe one more - if so, both A5 SB and Stinger will be on the list."
343,February 2,flightnurse,"I'm with you, my 330 suspension is base, but it has the right amount of firmness without being harsh. I like Stinger, I don't care if it doesn't have the best suspension I have no plans on tracking my cars again. But a 14K difference is a huge difference."
344,February 2,flightnurse,"MB been doing that now for 15  yrs with the CLS, it's an E class with a sleek body and they charge more for it."
345,February 2,coldinohio,kia stinger gt AWD-- this it top of line v6
346,February 2,dino001,"Now it's about the dealer - if I have to put up with some sleazball salesman who is used to selling stuff to people with 550 FICO and won't change his tune, I may be deterred by him.  Unfortunately my recent experiences at establishments selling ""mainstream"" cars have not been overly positive. To be blunt, every time I went to a place like that, I felt like needing a long hot shower.  Hopefully I'll get lucky next time."
347,February 3,roadburner,"That's my worry as well, not to mention potential warranty hassles if I took a Stinger to an HPDE. At least you can get it in RWD. Having said all that, my usual strategy of buying a 2-3 year old CPO works great for me, the only downside being the ability to tailor a car to my exact specs- for example if I had ordered my F22 it would have had a red interior, PDC, and no hole in the roof- but the $15,000 savings compensates for the ""imperfections."""
348,February 3,flightnurse,"I had wondered the same thing when Nissan started selling the GT-R here. Here is a dealership whose average sales price is about $25K, now sell a 90K car. If you don't want a KIA, then get a Genesis G70 with a manual. But I don't have a problem walking into Kia dealership to get my car serviced, and if it does have to get service I'm not too worried. I highly doubt they will screw things up, yeah, I won't get the free loaner have a nice lounge to sit in, but I saved 14K..."
349,February 3,qbrozen,"In a world of $60k pick-em-up trucks, I don't see how folks can be so snobbish about a $50k car, frankly."
350,February 3,Mr_Shiftright,"Maybe Kia could cash in on the ""reverse status"" thing----""EVERYONE has a BMW and Audi, but I have no need for such ostentatious displays"".   Tricky to pull that off, but it has been done."
351,February 3,flightnurse,was that how much you spent on your truck?
352,February 3,qbrozen,Mine had a sticker dangerously close to $50k and I don't even have leather!
353,February 3,flightnurse,"LOL, and people complain that a base 320i doesn't have power seats."
354,February 4,andres3,"Yes, but in order to really save 14K you'd have to have a car with similar specs and performance, now, you could argue your getting somewhere around 9/10th's for 8/10th's cost.  As with everything, there is a law of diminishing returns."
355,February 4,andres3,"After buying the S4, I didn't feel so bad about spending so much money once I saw how much people were spending on average trucks and SUV's."
356,February 4,flightnurse,"So I went and built a Stinger 2.0 RWD and a BMW 330i, I believe they are as close as you can get, and there is a 7K difference.  Now if you pick 4 series then it's close to 9K difference. When Genesis brings the G70 you will be able to get it with a 6 spd manual and the difference wont be that great but I'm sure the BMW will be more."
357,January 19,stickguy,I would add the upcoming new smaller genesis (3 series competitor).
358,January 19,flightnurse,"But the question is, what is Entry Level? As I wrote, my 330i MSRP was 47K, and does not have leather? What list of options or standard equipment makes it an Entry Level? If you added leather to my car the MSRP would have been close to 49K.  Just because it has BMW badge makes it ELLPS?"
359,January 19,Mr_Shiftright,"It's a marketing term, it's not something quantifiable."
360,January 19,andres3,Volvo?  Aren't they kind of like Buick? (snicker snicker).
361,January 19,flightnurse,I fully get it so why can't other brands be brought into conversations?
362,January 19,andres3,Spartan can mean different things to different people.
363,January 19,kyfdx,Luxury..   We decided it meant a luxury brand.
364,January 19,Mr_Shiftright,Well it's a consensus kind of thing. One has to set a limit somewhere--or as the old saying goes:
365,January 19,Michaell,
366,January 20,circlew,Then there is the 'near ellps' 2018 Kia Stinger. Nice car but no brand image as far as luxury goes.
367,January 20,stickguy,"yup.  Sometimes you get the car without the badge.  and sometimes you get the badge, without the car!  Up to each buyer to decide what is more important to them.  The drive or the prestige (posing)"
368,January 20,dino001,"I have to honestly say, I don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category.  To me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate.  It just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ELLPS by many."
369,January 20,stickguy,"the stinger really does seem like the acid test here.  Car looks to have everything required to be a playa' if (and around here too, a big if!) they can overcome the dealer experience."
370,January 20,flightnurse,Dino do tell about your 430 GC!!
371,January 20,roadburner,"My non-negotiables are RWD, ample(some would say ""too much"") hp, and top-shelf handling and braking- so yes, I'd at least"
372,January 20,roadburner,"Before I bought my M235i I also considered a Camaro SS 1LE, a Challenger SRT8, a 2013 Boss 302, a 2016 Mustang GT Premium w/Performance Package, a Lotus Elise, a 370Z NISMO, a Cayman S, and a WRX STI, so I didn't confine myself to the ELLPS market segment."
373,January 20,stickguy,"I just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review.  They list it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 MPH.  Top speed of 167.  If that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up NHRA."
374,January 20,roadburner,To each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just
375,January 20,qbrozen,"Have to remember, as far as I know, the Stinger's class is midsized. Yet magazines always seem fixated on comparing everything to the compact 3-series instead."
376,January 20,flightnurse,That is because Kia used the 3 series and its benchmark.
377,January 20,flightnurse,"RR mentioned the Giulia TI, which won Car of the Year. I loved the one I drove, but Alfa needed to rethink their leases, for a 45K car they wanted 3K down, and payments of $550/m But today you can get that same car for min down and 420/m which is in line with BMW."
378,January 20,Mr_Shiftright,"As does (did)  every other automaker. BMW practically invented ""sport sedan"", even before they got that posh image."
379,January 20,andres3,"Depending where you look, you might find different numbers.  I found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles reported for my '16 TTS.  Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level."
380,January 21,dino001,"The car is great so far.  I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d’Azur to Milan and back to Munich.  Then  picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa.  Now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect.  Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent.  Even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market.  The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed.  It’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328.  No longer Buick like.  I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3.  The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything."
381,January 21,dino001,3 series in no longer compact.  It grew in both size and weight.  It is a legitimate midsize today.
382,January 21,qbrozen,"Current 3-series sedan is 182"". 5-series is 194. Kia is 190. So definitely closer to the 5 than the 3."
383,January 21,circlew,"I looked at a white StingerGT2 2 weeks ago. I sat it in and it had far more room than my Q50S. I mentioned that it looked like a 5'er interior to the sales person. The exterior is far more upscale that is more up to date than a 3'er, IMHO."
384,January 21,dino001,"So the Stinger looks like a  legitimate effort from Kia.  Let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market.  If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives.  Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too.  One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW’s 3.0 six turbo.  It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech.  It may be a positive for some."
385,January 21,dino001,These are full lengths.  More important would be wheel base and cabin space/legroom. Does anybody have those handy?
386,January 21,Mr_Shiftright,Sounds like the 2 liter might be the better bang for the buck.
387,December 2017,flightnurse,What fires?
388,December 2017,roadburner,My son received his for his E90  328i.

390,December 2017,flightnurse,Interesting the article doesn't say much about what years are affected.
391,December 2017,Mr_Shiftright,
392,December 2017,roadburner,"The second recall involves the heated PCV valve. I talked with several techs at work and a couple of them said that they had seen blower motors with connectors that had gotten hot, but none of them looked like they were anywhere close to catching fire. No one had seen the PCV issue."
393,December 2017,Mr_Shiftright,"If you are the one affected, then the casualty rate is 100%"
394,December 2017,sweendogy,I've looked at a few different chats(blogs) here at edmunds and have been very impressed by the responses (certainly in the lease/deal sections) from the moderators. Nice work.
395,December 2017,Michaell,Thanks! Appreciate the shout out.
396,January 16,flightnurse,"Boy, this forum has died."
397,January 16,andres3,"I know what will revive this discussion.  Let's argue about what constitutes the right amount of luxury and performance to be a vehicle that fits ""Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedan."""
398,January 16,qbrozen,Only $200? At the dealer? That's a bargain.
399,January 17,roadburner,The Dinatronics Sport for my car is only $300.
400,January 17,carnaught,"These mods. sound nice, but do they they invalidate the warranty?"
401,January 17,roadburner,They can; a lot depends on the dealer and the amount of the warranty claim.
402,January 17,stickguy,"considering it is just a software update, it really should not be all that expensive.  Well, it could be if the value is there, but not like there is much labor or parts involved."
403,January 17,andres3,"Tuners claim the cost is to reimburse them for R&D, since it is just software."
404,January 17,stickguy,"oh sure, just like Microsoft, etc."
405,January 17,roadburner,The Dinantronic tunes are piggybacks.
406,January 17,qbrozen,"If the dealer offers it, they back it up"
407,January 17,qbrozen,
408,January 17,flightnurse,Not at the dealer many aftermarket companies
409,January 17,flightnurse,"This is true, however, I'm not worried as I don't abuse the engine enough be concerned."
410,January 17,qbrozen,Doesn't the dealer offer a tune? Or did they stop that?
411,January 17,flightnurse,BNW does not offer one for the 4 cyl in the US only the 6.
412,January 17,andres3,I did raise an objection to the tunes for the S4 (and TTS) for that matter costing more than the A3 tune.  The S4's is the most expensive.
413,January 17,andres3,For a while years back Audi let Stasis get in bed with them.
414,January 18,flightnurse,"As prices continue to climb what is really an ELLP?  If you are talking about the base model, mid-level model?"
415,January 19,Mr_Shiftright,I think it's a combination of badge + price more than the individual options list---although we do expect an ELLP not to be spartan in any way.
416,January 19,kyfdx,I'm pretty sure that
417,October 2017,qbrozen,"I am also wondering about Fiat. They were WAY down at the tail end before, so I'm pretty sure there is still one worse than Caddy."
418,October 2017,pensfan83,I guess there isn't enough data for Alfa Romeo yet?
419,October 2017,dino001,"Well, I didn't have much experience with Audi, except my late dad's 2004 A4 TDI (in Poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on Edmund's forums, like GG's infamous S4 problems and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous CTS when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problems with the entertainment system).  BTW, I have to say from years of posting, GG looks like a magnet for bad cars."
420,October 2017,stickguy,Acura is probably entirely related to the 9 speed AT
421,October 2017,ab348,Nor with BMW or Toyota. I guess my 2 flawless Cadillacs don't count either.
422,October 2017,stickguy,"Well, in a survey, any individual response really doesn't mean much."
423,October 2017,graphicguy,"dino....seems that way, doesn't it."
424,October 2017,stickguy,"quite likely.  there is also some time lag to those surveys, so what you buy today may be different than what got dinged."
425,October 2017,Mr_Shiftright,"I wouldn't give Audi that much slack, to say that they were reliable in the mid 2000s. I think it took a few years longer than that for them to get quality control UNDER control."
426,October 2017,andres3,"Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus."
427,October 2017,andres3,"Well, they did tend to have AC issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue).  For a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 K warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%.  I had a window regulator and AC go bad, and I needed the intake module replaced on my A3 by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the Open sky so you can't break what you don't have)."
428,October 2017,andres3,"They count, but you've only had the 2nd one for how long?"
429,October 2017,andres3,"You didn't own the Infiniti long enough, but it seems the Asian brands are your anti/counter-magnet to getting bad cars as"

432,October 2017,graphicguy,Good point!
433,October 2017,flightnurse,"Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus."
434,October 2017,thebean,Hard to see the point given that you seem prone to simply dismiss any such reports that do not fit your narrative.
435,October 2017,roadburner,I picked up the latest issue of
436,October 2017,qbrozen,I have seen that comparison a number of times now and the verdict is almost never the same. Although I do believe the RS5 always finishes last.
437,October 2017,stickguy,"depends a lot on priorities, as with every comparison test."
438,October 2017,flightnurse,"When was younger I would live, breath and sleep these comparison test, I could quote stats all day long. But as I got older and owned some of these cars I realized that numbers really don't mean much, since testing is never done at the same time of year, or track or weather condition. So for the average Joe any one of these cars would be OK with and no see any of the ""issues"" the writers saw.  I wouldn't mind having any of those cars and I know I would happy owning it.  Now, I wish BMW would build a M4 GC..."
439,October 2017,roadburner,I've been reading comparison tests since 1967; I find the magazines that most closely mirror my preferences are
440,October 2017,flightnurse,"I've been a fan of Peter Egan for years, because of writing also motor Motorcyclist. I was very lucky to spend 5 days with him back in the early 90's on a motorcycle ""festival"" called The Three Flags, very fascinating person.  All of those cars you posted will exceed the posted speed limit many times over, handles MUCH better then most people will push and for those reasons doesn't matter what car people will buy, Most if not all will never push those cars to their respected limits. That is why I think those articles are boring, What I think would be interesting is these magazines would take a BMW 320 and put against say a Kia Optima and see if the added cost for the BMW is worth it. Or take a 330i v Altima, Accord, Camry, Sonata, Optima and see if the additional cost of the BMW is worth the price. Since it seems that many people troll this board for that topic."
441,October 2017,andres3,"I'd find badge engineering comparos interesting.   Pit an X1 against the Mini equivalent, a GTI against the A3, the Smart Car against the......  well, never mind."
442,October 2017,tlong,How is it that my 12 yo Acura TL looked good and was highly reliable. And yet the new TLX IMHO doesn't look as good and Acura's reliablity is in the dumper according to CR. Not a lot of progress in 12 years.

445,December 2017,sweendogy,"The the comment above - I hope the BMW wins. BMW has been leasing ""el cheapo"" cars for years and calling them the ultimate driving machines. (Talking 320 for those new here) Would be great to see if they can beat a Ultima (Nissan).  For 299 a month I think the BMW should win - at msrp I would think it could be tougher-"
446,December 2017,circlew,Anyone get the recall regarding parts implicated in BMW fires?
447,October 2017,flightnurse,Why not wonder if a Kia Rio handles just as good as a 330i.
448,October 2017,iluvmysephia1,
449,October 2017,roadburner,"Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic."
450,October 2017,roadburner,That does it- the 2er and 3er are going on Craigslist and I'm headed to the Kia Store!!!
451,October 2017,brian125,
452,October 2017,brian125,Agree .. my neighbor's  kid has the mazda6  which  has 19's. I'm not a mazda6 fan but the handling on this Mazda is excellent
453,October 2017,roadburner,I had a Mazdaspeed 3 and I really liked it. My wife may well end up getting a CX-3 in a year or two. Mazda is my favorite of all the Asian brands; I actually put off replacing my Mazdaspeed3 for a year in hopes that the rumored 300hp AWD Mazdaspeed3 was coming to market. No such luck...
454,October 2017,Mr_Shiftright,In the right hands......
455,October 2017,iluvmysephia1,"Bingo, shifty!"
456,October 2017,Michaell,Yet I get the feeling we've strayed a bit off topic this last day or two.
457,October 2017,stickguy,"Not any longer!  Though my looking supported a theory of mine. This class is hurting, because the competition from below is fierce.  Mainstream cars, for much less money, that are so good already that the extra money is hard to justify for many people.   Especially in the smaller models."
458,October 2017,tlong,"Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay."
459,October 2017,laurasdada,"That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving...  Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste.  Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries.  Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats?  I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life!  I like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm."
460,October 2017,stickguy,"well, my pending Elantra sport is an interesting example, compared to my son's A3.  Not as many gizmos (his is loaded).  But similar size, comparable performance (short of Quattro), many same features.  similar ride and handling.  Less prestigious badge.  But for most people, not a huge difference.  Other than price, which was a full $20,000 cheaper."
461,October 2017,Michaell,"Interesting - forgot about the A3 in your family. A longer term comparison will be interesting. Gotta have your son drive the Hyundai and offer his opinion. Better yet, let him take it to NY and drive it for a month (when the weather is nicer)."
462,October 2017,roadburner,If you want a RWD sport sedan the mainstream brands really don't offer any competition- although the Genesis G80/G90 and the KIA Stinger are notable exceptions. If you don't care which wheels are driven and simply want a wide assortment of gadgets then a bread and butter sedan may well be the way to go.
463,October 2017,andres3,But is it really comparable?
464,October 2017,Michaell,I think the point is you can get 80% (or more) of the performance and features for 50% of the price.
465,October 2017,stickguy,"yes, pretty much.  The incremental improvement costs a whole lotta money."
466,October 2017,Mr_Shiftright,"Well that's the whole marketing scheme isn't it? To dangle a few extra baubles in front of the consumer so that he upgrades?  I mean, isn't advertising about making you dissatisfied with what you already own?  Certainly, that seems to drive the leasing of ELLPS, at any rate."
467,October 2017,graphicguy,Wow.....this old thread is back.  Got really contentious in here for a while so I ignored it.  Good to see it in friendlier confines.
468,October 2017,Mr_Shiftright,A car with that MSRP came with a battery tender?  LOL!
469,October 2017,flightnurse,"Interesting, now I came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before.  Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it.. But overall I can't see how a Mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"
470,October 2017,flightnurse,"LOL ah, the good old day when ELLPS were cheap... The price of your 1998 A4 is the same cost of a middle-level Nissan Altma..  Have fun with one of those."
471,October 2017,tlong,"That's true in most markets, not just cars."
472,October 2017,benjaminh,"For reliability, according to Consumer Reports, Lexus is at the top and Cadillac is at the bottom...."
473,October 2017,dino001,"I find Audi, BMW and Kia at top almost shocking.  Especially Audi.  Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there.  Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting."
474,October 2017,andres3,Audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's.   Where have you been?
475,October 2017,tlong,Kind of amazing how Honda has slipped. And Acura much more so.
476,October 2017,flightnurse,So his experience with Audi didn't count?
477,June 2017,flightnurse,"I had the BMS stage 1 on my 320 and never had an issue, I'm not worrying about the JB4."
478,June 2017,flightnurse,"I rolled some negative cash from the 320 into this new car, the value of the 320 was falling, and wasn't going to get better."
479,June 2017,qbrozen,"Question is if it will void your warranty. And the answer is yes. At least as far as damage that may be related to it, such as the entire drivetrain."
480,June 2017,andres3,The trick is finding a dealership and service advisers that ignore a TD1 flagging.
481,June 2017,qbrozen,"Mine was good about it and helped me get things fixed but he did say if the engine blows, for example, there isn't much they can do because corporate will inspect the computer and find out."
482,July 2017,flightnurse,"There is always a change but my 320 and Ricks 328 hasn't had an issue, I don't plan on pushing more than the tune."
483,October 2017,flightnurse,Boy did this forum die....
484,October 2017,kyfdx,Along with the sedan...
485,October 2017,Michaell,"In the interest of reviving this thread, I pose a hypothetical."
486,October 2017,qbrozen,Q50
487,October 2017,roadburner,"Drive them all and buy what YOU like. I want a RWD, car, so that biases my choices"
488,October 2017,stickguy,C class is really really nice.
489,October 2017,Michaell,"Yeah, I've been admiring them lately."
490,October 2017,carnaught,"You pretty much can’t go wrong with all of the above.  The only thing I have against a 3-Series is that they haven’t changed much, and the interior has remained essentially the same through the years.  Still wouldn’t throw it out of bed for eating crackers.  It’s all personal choice."
491,October 2017,flightnurse,"Your statement is completely wrong, The 3 series has changed where it was needed, with the new B46 engine I feel it is a lot more fun to drive as the torque is lower in the rev band. The small changes to the interior and iDrive software has been an improvement."
492,October 2017,carnaught,
493,October 2017,dino001,"I just bought 2018 430i Gran Coupe.  Keen eye would see subtle difference with the 330 sedan, but from a distance they both look similar.  BMW has made a decent progress in addressing my largest complaint, i.e. steering wheel and suspension feel.  It's not quite as heavy as my previous 2018 328, but it got to the area where it's no longer Buick.  The interior is improved, the stitched plastic dashboard cover is a nice touch.  One thing that feels really old and tired, are the speedometer and odometer.  Almost the same as they were 10 years ago, which were almost the same as those 10 years prior that.  I even joke that those BMW designers obsess about their engine, transmission and everything else, then three weeks before launch they suddenly realize that they need a new dashboard, so they stick the old one, again."
494,October 2017,flightnurse,"When it comes to looks, you can tell BMW is playing it safe, the look is evolution and bold and in your face like what Acura had done to the TL, I think the BMW is a handsome sedan. I'm not 100% sold on the new C class but like the looks of the A4."
495,October 2017,flightnurse,"Congrats on the 430, so you went with the 8 Spd auto, how you like it? I'm still leaning towards a 440 GC next."
496,October 2017,dino001,"I went with auto, cause there wasn't anything else available with GC.  When I was preparing to change from my wagon, I made peace with AT as my next transmissions already some time ago.  I decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission.  The transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless.  It isn't manual, but it will do."
497,October 2017,pensfan83,"Aside from a 3 year stint with the Fusion I've had a manual for the better part of the last 15 years, granted not as long as some here but long enough that was very accustomed to the enjoyment of rowing my own gears.  I lucked out in 2014 when it came to the A4 however this time my dealer had no manual A4's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman said they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day.  Like"
498,October 2017,roadburner,"I've come to the point where I prefer manuals in cars that really need one- those with engines that need to be wound out to make significant power, like my Club Sport. With engines that make peak torque from 1300-4500 rpm-such as the N55 and B58-I prefer theZF 8HP; it shifts quickly, rev matches, and has a true manual mode."
499,October 2017,Mr_Shiftright,"That's my feeling. If you don't need to work the stick, then don't buy the stick."
500,October 2017,laurasdada,"Michaell, since shopping is free and fun, and you never know which dealer will have free food!, why not visit your local Jag dealer too, and check out the XE?  Good driving from what I've read, interior may not be up to snuff (more performance than lux).  But, only you can decide what floats your boat."
501,October 2017,ab348,That is something that sadly has gone away here in recent years. There was one GM dealer in particular that always had free food on offer. It changed ownership and that is now gone.
502,October 2017,stickguy,"we looked at a used Jag XF (2013) Wednesday.  Wife was not impressed by the interior (I found the seats fantastic, her less so, but mostly because is was that odd orange color).  But the part she found oddest was when I finally figured out how to put the AC on, and the vents rotated open and close.  Just seems like a solution to a problem that did not exist, and one more thing to break (expensively)."
503,October 2017,andres3,"I don't have any experience with BMW's DCT's.  I heard the early ones a long time ago were lackluster to put it nicely, but I thought they had made vast improvements?  What would be your ""complaint"" list on the current crop of the latest and greatest DCT's from BMW?"
504,October 2017,roadburner,"They are okay onde you are on the move, but they are a bit laggy at low speeds and when shifting from forward to reverse."
505,October 2017,john4545,Mazda6 handling vs  BMW 330 . Does Mazda6 have a leg to stand on?? Love to see the 6 in a manual? I thought the 17 Mazda's handling was superb
506,October 2017,andres3,I'd imagine if the Mazda 6 was given an upgraded wheel/tire size it would hang as long as horsepower was previously agreed to not be used.
507,May 2017,kyfdx,$5500
508,May 2017,graphicguy,"Driven the TLX a couple of times (V6).  If those incentives were going on when I was looking, my choice might have been different (ended up with a Q50 3.0T, which I like quite a bit)."
509,May 2017,stickguy,"I drove a 2015, with about 30k on it. Trans seemed fine.  The 2018s hit in June I think per salesguy. If I was buying now, would jump on a 4 cyl tech with all the incentives.  Maybe the 18s are worth waiting for, but who knows what the deals will be like at year end."
510,May 2017,graphicguy,"Agreed.  That said, dealers are going to try to hold to MSRP on the '18s for as long as they can.  I might look at them this time next year.  But, for right now, a $45K '17 TLX SH-AWD ADVANCE would probably be in the realm of $35-$36K.  The 4 cyl would probably be close, or maybe even below $30K.  Both would be a screaming deal on a fun, reliable car."
511,May 2017,flightnurse,Don't say it's so
512,May 2017,andres3,You'll be fine.  The B8.5 S4 is one of the finest cars ever made.  Find a good indy shop for the services.  My TTS was quoted $450 (w/ DSG) for the 35K service.  I imagine the S4 would be within 10% of that at most.
513,May 2017,sweendogy,Andres3 - yes no issues yet and I enjoy it a great deal. Was told I need new summer tires soon which will be expensive.
514,May 2017,stickguy,"Acura got out of the sporty/hot car deal a while ago.  And they do have a Civic and CRV (ILX and RDX).  They are both just ready to be replaced.  For the last models, they followed about 6-12 months after the Honda doner car was redesigned."
515,May 2017,graphicguy,Already did......
516,May 2017,stickguy,"I had my eye on the TLX all along.  Though I did kinda forget about it there for a while, but now back on the list.  At least the wife likes it a lot too, which of course will make my life more pleasant!"
517,May 2017,sweendogy,Seems acura got out of the sedan/car biz for what seems 10 years ... Maybe more. They used to compete vs Lexus. Now it seems Buick.
518,May 2017,sda,If I was in the market now the TLX with technology 4 or V6 would be high on my list.  I have been very pleased with Honda products.
519,May 2017,andres3,I think even Honda fans will Admit that there's a reason Acura can't get much more than 90% of MSRP on their sedans the last decade or so though.  Combination of overpriced and under-delivering in my opinion.
520,May 2017,sweendogy,"While I agree Acura has become Buick - don't get me going on them- Infiniti has become even more irrelevant. While Acura has the MDX, Infiniti has zero products that are upper third (half) of any category in Luxury market. They used to have the g sedan and coupe (something Acura and Lexus forgot about) that actually sold and could compare to BMW 3."
521,May 2017,qbrozen,"Yeah, it doesn't compare. it has surpassed the 3."
522,May 2017,sweendogy,If you are talking Mazda 3 I agree. Infiniti doesn't want it's used cars back. (I would guess BMW is similar)
523,May 2017,roadburner,At my dealer we take in a
524,May 2017,tlong,"When I bought my 2005 Acura TL in late 2004, Acura was on a roll with the best looking car (IMHO, still love that styling) and Infiniti had the G35 which was also a looker and doing well. Fast forward 12 years and Acura has lost it, and so seems has Infiniti, at least in the sporty sedan arena. Audi is resurgent and BMW is treading water/surviving on it's long standing reputation. And I think cars in general are less of an interest than then, with Tesla/electrics, hybrids, Uber, Lyft all competing for transportation, along with gadgets and the internet for people's cash."
525,May 2017,flightnurse,Local Acura dealers are discounting the TLX 4 cyl with tech 7K. Not too sure if a TLX is a good idea unless you are shopping strictly on price.
526,May 2017,stickguy,I really like the TLX.  Just fits me well.
527,May 2017,sweendogy,TL TLX amazed how Acura got it wrong... Here is the new TLX
528,May 2017,flightnurse,"Went and drove a 4 cyl with Tech and 6 cyl W/ tech and was disappointed. I think Acura is the new Infiniti in which they lost their Mojo. It's sad to see this, it's even sadder that Infiniti has to use German Engines and Transmissions to get the powertrain right...  It's even sadder that they are discounting the TLX do much to move them off the lots."
529,May 2017,stickguy,"I have not driven a 4 cyl yet, but really liked the 6 cyl I tried.  But that is why they make so many different cars.  something for (almost) everyone!"
530,May 2017,flightnurse,"The big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. The V6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in Sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. Now I will give the seats major props here very comfortable. The car drove with typical Japanese blandness very isolated feeling. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. The dealer I went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/Tech but didn't see the real value in it. The only difference between a 4 and 6cyl Tech package is the engine and transmission there is not additional equipment in the 6 cyl since more manufacturers add features Honda/Acura does not."
531,May 2017,sweendogy,Infiniti and Acura are lost for sure... Lexus has at least made the effort with the (ugly?) IS.... They also have the volume es and rx to help the rest of the fleet. Infiniti has 2 highly discounted sedan and suv (pathfinder q)  that I guess is the reason Nissan gives them a lifeline. Acura has one real product the MDX. Yes they have a super car which is cool but unfortunately in its current stable you can't look down the line and say it has a real bloodline. The old nsx had the integra r and gsr (had one) to point to.
532,June 2017,andres3,"I agree Acura seems to be lost; they gave up on their 3.7 engine, which is strange for Honda/Acura to give up on an engine so quickly."
533,June 2017,flightnurse,I'm thinking Acura will be dropping a turbo 4 into the TLX within the next 2 yrs. Honda will have a Turbo 4 in the Accord next year.
534,June 2017,flightnurse,"Out with the old and in with the new. It was time to get a new car, my first choice was the Alfa loved how it drove, and for the price hard to beat, but when it came to lease payments, yicks...  Basically told the dealer when they were serious about selling the car to call me."
535,June 2017,qbrozen,"Warning: the BMS will void your warranty. Unless the dealers have started offering it, which would shock me."
536,June 2017,stickguy,sounds like the car I would look at later in the year (the service loaner lease part).  What did the before tax payment end up being on that?
537,October 2016,dino001,"XC60 is still only one line.  That's the thing - most dealers didn't even stock R-line trims, so one wouldn't know about their existence without more extensive research.  The salesman told me it's getting a little better after acquisition of Polestar, but will surely take time to get any following.  Plus, those are much more risky models to stock, more expensive low volumes."
538,October 2016,graphicguy,
539,October 2016,andres3,"I've heard of and looked at them briefly.  I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4.  Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor.  It just doesn't win on any specification.  And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago).  Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255.  My wife's Sportwagen has 225.  That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle."
540,December 2016,flightnurse,Not much talk in the last 2 months..
541,January 2017,roadburner,We just got our first two G30s- a 540i xDrive M Sport and a 530i xDrive Sport Line(shown below). I've driven the 530i and I like it MUCH better than any F10 I have driven. The car feels a lot faster than I expected. It's still a bit too big for my tastes but it's really an impressive drive.
542,January 2017,andres3,Why were you doing head/handstands when you took those pics?
543,January 2017,Mr_Shiftright,Now those are some sticky tires!
544,January 2017,andres3,"That's a very nice good-looking blue on the BMW 5-Series.  If Kia's blue on the Optima was more like that and less Purple/Violet, I'd have selected it!"
545,January 2017,ab348,"Are those the ""new"" 5-series introduced at NAIAS earlier this month?"
546,January 2017,stickguy,That is them.
547,January 2017,kyfdx,"How can the E codes be good for BMW for 40 years, but it only took 10 years to blow through the F codes, and now it's G?"
548,January 2017,carnaught,"While I'm sure the drive is much better, I hope the interior is more revolutionary than evolutionary in change than the exterior."
549,January 2017,roadburner,Because now every permutation gets a new number. The E36 code covered
550,January 2017,roadburner,"That's SOP for Munich, every extensive redesign is followed by a more conservative replacement. See: E12, E28, E34, E39, E60, F10. The G30 is the low key model transformation."
551,January 2017,andres3,"Audi Club guys like to refer to their A4's and S4's as B5 or B6, or B7, or B8, or now B9 A4's and S4's."
552,January 2017,dino001,"Year ranges are fine, but can be tricky, when certain model variations carry longer than others.  Example:  2012 328 sedan was F30, but all other bodies were still E9x, like my wagon.  IIRC 3-series convertible carried all through 2013, before being replaced by 2014 F3x 4-series."
553,January 2017,tlong,They should handle it like software versions. You could be driving an E36.2.2!
554,January 2017,smallinjeck,"I personally love Mercedes C-Class. Besides its prestigious status, this sedan is spacious and very easy to drive."
555,January 2017,stickguy,We sat in one at the car show. It was a nice impressive package.  My wife loved it a lot.
556,January 2017,PF_Flyer,"If you recently sold or traded in a BMW for a Mercedes, Jaguar, Volvo, Audi or Cadillac vehicle, a reporter would be interested in speaking with you about your experience. Please send a note to PR@Edmunds.com no later than 5 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017. Thanks!"
557,February 2017,sweendogy,I'm back..... Noticed this forum still going which is nice to see.. Update 2013 B8.5 s4 now has 35k miles. No problems thus far with just routine maintenance to report along with one quarter panel needed to be replaced after the neighbor backed into it last feb. Just recently had the 35k service done which also included a transmission flush and filter replacement. Funny thing about Audi service they don't advertise Audi care - which you can bundle 2 10k services for 800 bux. Not cheap but considering the 35k service alone I was quoted 900 - and that's just for One service.
558,February 2017,andres3,Dealership service rates have gone mad.
559,May 2017,sweendogy,Wow haven't been here since February - and well nothing has changed - update 2013 s4 warrantee just expired - so 4 year old Audi 37k miles (remember I bot it 10 months old with 14k). Do I trade it for a CPO? Buy a new one? Or keep it (love it) knowing the service bell will be ringing at some point around 40k?
560,May 2017,cdnpinhead,"Two people drive this board, and you're one of them.  Welcome back."
561,May 2017,stickguy,"I assume it counts, but last week I test drove a V6 TLX advance.  It was very nice."
562,May 2017,benjaminh,The deals on the TLX are supposed to be very nice right now. I've heard it's possible to get as much as $7k off of list on the V-6 model.
563,May 2017,benjaminh,Entry-level luxury sales for April:
564,May 2017,kyfdx,Should be able to do better than that..   $6250 of incentives on the V-6 model.
565,May 2017,ab348,Has Acura fixed the transmission issues on the TLX V-6 model?
566,May 2017,benjaminh,Wow. What are the incentives on the 4-cylinder TLX?
567,October 2016,brian125,Tks
568,October 2016,roadburner,Will do!
569,October 2016,brian125,
570,October 2016,qbrozen,I am. He's got a couple of places in Freehold that I have been to. I test drove the RX350 and GLK350 at the Benz and Lexus dealers there within the past couple of weeks. Salesguy at the Lexus dealer was very very good.
571,October 2016,sda,That's sad.  There is a handsome looking black 750 iL that I saw last week pulling away from a stop light belching blue smoke out the exhaust.  It reminded me of my Vega years ago.
572,October 2016,brian125,Q what years did you test drive  ? which did you like better
573,October 2016,andres3,"Let me guess, an A8, an S8, and an R8?"
574,October 2016,brian125,"Looks like they shuffled the line up inside but yes when you walk in you see these beautiful   A/S8, RS7's, TT, Q7's , SQ5's  scroll down on my pic of the dealership showroom floor. The  line has changed or this is when they 1st opened.  Last I was in there they has a red and silver TT side by side. Sharp and sharper."
575,October 2016,brian125,This one is better  Ray Catena
576,October 2016,brian125,
577,October 2016,brian125,And yes I lost 3yrs off my 2001 start date to. I might of had a different name thou?
578,October 2016,stever,"No, everyone (I think) got sent back to 2001 with the software switch."
579,October 2016,brian125,Only if it comes with a fine bottle of Scotch
580,October 2016,qbrozen,"2013 GLK, and I think 2010? Rx350. I was really disappointed in the Lexus. Although the interior was nice, it drove/felt like a much cheaper vehicle. GLK drove great but I just could not get comfortable in it."
581,October 2016,stickguy,I found the GLC to be a nice upgrade over the GLK comfort and interior wise.  I would be real happy with one of those.  Not that it will be in my budget for a long time.
582,October 2016,brian125,"GLC is high on my wifes new ride list.  I priced a 2017 w leather, premium pck, Sport pck,, heads up display and upgrade  surround sound.  Pricey at 50k. The Selenite grey which we both like  was a $720  color option."
583,October 2016,brian125,Actually I just looked at my spread sheet the  17 GLC  I priced was invoiced at 51k.
584,October 2016,flightnurse,"The BMW you owned didn't have the N63 engine, this could be one reason for no issues."
585,October 2016,flightnurse,But you can't build one on BMW website and the pricing guide has not been released.
586,October 2016,flightnurse,"When we were looking for Rick next car, we drive a 2015 RX350, and was very disappointed in it, there was no refinement in that thing. There was no sound deadening, the ride was horrible, and the interior screamed Toyota. The NX we drove was far better but was too small."
587,October 2016,flightnurse,"We went and looked at the new C coupe and while at the dealership looked at the GLC impressed with both, a big upgrade over the GLK. 50K seems to be the price for a well equipped SUV."
588,October 2016,roadburner,That's up to BMW NA; I'd think that the information will be released in the very near future- but I'm just guessing.
589,October 2016,tlong,Well I'm just over 5K and I aint seen no stinkin' mug or tee shirt!

593,October 2016,stever,"Ha, see if I mail you any more Edmunds pens."
594,October 2016,dino001,"I just stumbled on a great ELLPS - Volvo S60/V60 R-Design trim.  305 horses, very nice cabin, all goodies included, around 50 grand sticker.  Just drove one, nice steering feedback, better than first intallment on F3x 3-series (improved by now, but still),  nice suspension.  Drives as well as my 328, it is a bit faster, AWD.  Looks good, too.  Lots of value.  I may be really tempted to save some money versus 440 Grand Coupe, or even 430.  Volvo always has some good incentives, or I could also take Overseas Delivery, which doesn't have them, but you get two ticketsvticket on Premium Economy with SAS (4 grand value, I know for a fact),  full concierge experience in Goetynburgh and hotel stay.  That's more than BMW's ED."
595,October 2016,Mr_Shiftright,It broke already.
596,October 2016,flightnurse,"We looked at Volvo the XC60, at the time the tickets were only coach, I'm not sold on the supercharge and turbo charged engine. I like the S90 but they need more then a 4 cyl."
597,September 2016,flightnurse,Here is a deal someone posted on Bimmerfest.
598,September 2016,roadburner,"Funny thing; one of our most successful client advisors is an attorney who retired from a large well-respected Louisville law firm. As you might expect, his client base is heavily populated with attorneys. I delivered a 440i convertible to one of his clients who had bought himself the car for a retirement present; he had been a top notch criminal defense attorney and as we walked out to the car he asked, ""Are you as glad to be out of the legal field as much as I am?"""
599,October 2016,brian125,"Was checking out Tesla's last week. What a sharp Car... In the last quarter, Tesla sold 9,156 examples of the Model S.  Mercedes sold  4,921 S-Classes, and the BMW 7 Series came in third with 3,634 units sold. That puts Tesla's share of the segment, which includes 12 different vehicles, at 32 percent. It's by and large the king of this segment, helped by a 59 percent year-over-year improvement.  The Tesla S is a beautiful vehicle very classy and luxurious. Shame its range is useless in my world."
600,October 2016,flightnurse,and this..
601,October 2016,brian125,All  good facts and  info . Another thing I forgot to mention was Tesla sells on 2 Lux cars.
602,October 2016,andres3,Curious if you know if the Genesis/Cadenza's are made in the USA like the Optima.  Usually manufacturer's make their flagship where quality matters more than lowest bidder.
603,October 2016,brian125,I know Hyundai has a plant in Montgomery but I'm guessing the Genesis is being made in South Korea.  Just a guess thou. I know there were talks to assembly here last year don't know much more .
604,October 2016,andres3,"What's the first letter and/or number on the VIN for your Genesis; that'll tell us the answer, at least in 2013."
605,October 2016,brian125,Its K..............assuming that means Korea???????
606,October 2016,andres3,"Yeah, see, they don't trust us filthy Americans with their best stuff."
607,October 2016,brian125,andres3
608,October 2016,andres3,"I like Harmon other wise known as HK.  Don't think they should drop the Kardon part.   My previous receiver which I still have is an HK.  I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore.  When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK.  Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it."
609,October 2016,flightnurse,"I highly doubt the 530i will start at 60K, that is almost 10K more than the 2016 528i, and over 5K more then a 2017 E350. Since pricing hasn't been released I'm thinking base price for a 530i will be close to 53-55K. The standard equipment list for the 530i is impressive."
610,October 2016,flightnurse,Here are some interesting articles.
611,October 2016,brian125,I'd buy the G80 over the G90 (Old Equus model ) Its a better buy for the money.
612,October 2016,flightnurse,"We had a first Gen Genesee and liked it, and with the improvements of the new gen I can see sales being taken away from Lexus and MB."
613,October 2016,brian125,The G90 reviews on Edmunds  (old Euuis )  are not as good as the G80.
614,October 2016,roadburner,"The 550i is nice enough, I just find the F10 too soft for my tastes. I think I'd rather have an M Sport X5 xDrive50i. I still think that the 340i is the sweet spot- for BMW sedans at any rate."
615,October 2016,flightnurse,"I was under the impression that all Dealers were getting 2 G30's as demo now, I like the concept of the 550i but that engine just has too many issue for me to spend 80K and have it break down like they have."
616,October 2016,roadburner,I just confirmed the info with my NCM; our center isn't expected to see a G30 until late January.
617,October 2016,flightnurse,The 550i with the n63TU engine has known issues stay away from them even though the N63Tu is the updated version of the N63 engine it still has problems. Its a great car but the engine has known issues.
618,October 2016,flightnurse,When can people start to order the G30?
619,October 2016,brian125,
620,October 2016,brian125,I like the color combo on this X5 / m
621,October 2016,flightnurse,YOU want info on the N63 engine issues
622,October 2016,brian125,"I can honestly say I  had a good run with  limited problems with my 2 older bought new Bmw  750's ( 95, 2000 )  and now on my 3rd X-5 ( 08,12,16)"
623,October 2016,roadburner,I will find out and post it.
624,October 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Wow you really dodged a bullet on the 7 Series....good for you!
625,October 2016,roadburner,The G30 5er can be ordered immediately. Our earliest build date is week 51.
626,October 2016,jpp5862,"I rode in an uber early Thursday morning on my way to the airport.  The car was a black Hyundai Genesis, an older model but I couldn't tell how old but what impressed me was it had 139k miles on it and was smooth and quiet as a new car.  I was impressed with the ride given the amount of miles."
627,August 2016,brian125,I bet if you guys stop  going threw cars like I do underwear you can buy a 60k  vehicle.
628,August 2016,stickguy,"Well, can, and would, are not the same thing."
629,August 2016,Michaell,"Hey, I resemble that remark!"
630,August 2016,flightnurse,Here is a short review of the 2017 MB E300.. 70K for this car...
631,August 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Looks like that link is funky....try this one
632,August 2016,flightnurse,"Not too sure what happened, but here is the link from the current test drive of the online C&D."
633,September 2016,flightnurse,So what has happened to everybody?
634,September 2016,sandman_6472,"Might sound dumb, but what are MSD'S? Have no clue what these are since we've never leased. Please educate me on these."
635,September 2016,qbrozen,Multiple security deposits
636,September 2016,flightnurse,"MSD's mean Multi Security Deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. At the end of your lease you will get your MSD's back or if you want and lease another BMW you can roll the MSD's into your new lease. The added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."
637,September 2016,Mr_Shiftright,And the benefits to the leasing company are what exactly?....that you get someone to lease who might not have?  Or get them into a more expensive lease rather than the one they first chose prior to the MSD bait?
638,September 2016,flightnurse,"The benefit isn't to the leasing company, and those who understand leasing and can negotiate well, can get a better deal with the MSD, then without."
639,September 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"So who does it benefit, is what I'm asking?  Why create a system that makes less profit?"
640,September 2016,Michaell,The leasing company gets the use of the MSD funds for the duration of the lease. Add it up and you can make a decent amount of money if you invest it right.
641,September 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Ah, so they get the ""float"".   I suppose if their money rate is 2.5%, then they can beat that by investing your money elsewhere."
642,September 2016,dino001,"Like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary.   Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment).  In some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent."
643,September 2016,m6user,It's kind of like collateral.  Less risk for lender equals a liitle lower rate in addition to use of funds.
644,September 2016,roadburner,"If I max out the MSDs I can get a 24 month/10,000 miles per year lease on a 2016 i3 REX for less than $90 per month with no money down."
645,September 2016,Michaell,"Yeah, I figured you could score an amazing lease deal as an employee. That's a $50k car, right?"
646,September 2016,roadburner,Yep; I could also get a 2016 M3 lease on the same terms for about $600/month.
647,September 2016,Michaell,So what qualifications does one need to be a genius at a BMW store?
648,September 2016,graphicguy,"You must be a judge, or at least, a lawyer."
649,September 2016,kyfdx,Some programs are anomalies and counter-intuitive.
650,September 2016,Mr_Shiftright,What do the max MSDs total out as?
651,September 2016,kyfdx,It's the monthly payment rounded up to the next $50 increment times 7.
652,September 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"So, couple thousand?"
653,September 2016,kyfdx,"I leased a 2011 Z4 service loaner for $335/mo, all in.   Seven MSDs were $2450.  Save $46/mo. on a 24 month lease.  (insanely cheap lease... original MSRP of $55K)"
654,September 2016,Michaell,"If the lease payment is $350, then $2450 total."
655,September 2016,flightnurse,"On Bimmerfest I'm seeing people posting leases on a i3REX for $189/m That is with max MSD's and min down (tax, Doc, 1st pmt)"
656,September 2016,roadburner,
657,July 2016,Michaell,"Exactly. The problem is, not all manufacturers offer MSD for leases. A quick summary - and I'll let"
658,July 2016,kyfdx,Infiniti:   9 MSDs at .00010 each (.00090 total)
659,July 2016,brian125,You would be foolish to lease one of these brands and not take full advantage of the savings. Depending on the MB  dealer most are supported  who  offer MSD.
660,July 2016,flightnurse,"Dino it is being judgmental, but many people would agree with you, on BF some 23 yr old out of college wanting to lease a new 340i, his payments are $600/m cough.... Should he have gotten that car, no, but no one was going to stop him, and BMWFS sure wasn't.."
661,July 2016,flightnurse,"MB has MSD, but they aren't offered in all states, just like Audi as well as BMW."
662,July 2016,flightnurse,"This is true, however, there are people who don't have 4K sitting around in a bank."
663,July 2016,andres3,What is the average monthly car payment nationwide?  For both leases and buyers?  I bet it wouldn't take a year of saving car payments to save up that $4K for most people.
664,July 2016,flightnurse,"According to Edmunds.com, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle is $479. IF one wanted to make money on about 4K, one would use MSD's and save $50/m which is about 1900 on a three year lease. I can tell you one could get a nice 528i for $480/m with the currently RV that BMWFS is giving..."
665,July 2016,dino001,"Right is right, that's why I wrote ""too judgmental"".  Anyway, one can do whatever they want, but I can also voice my opinion about the action.  I just don't want to hear their complaints about Bush, Obama, bankers, Wall Street, or global warming next time their life and income prospects turn less then anticipated."
666,July 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"I remember that Forbes, some time ago, did a survey asking American families if they would go into crisis if one month's salary failed to arrive. The response was very unsettling."
667,July 2016,brian125,Probably just as bad today if not worse.

669,August 2016,benjaminh,
670,August 2016,graphicguy,Maybe that's Cadillac's intent....to cut away more marginal dealers who can't/won't offer a higher level of customer service.
671,August 2016,roadburner,Auto dealers have a huge of influence at the state and Federal level. For better or worse it makes it difficult for automakers to bring their dealers to heel.
672,August 2016,dino001,"I have always maintained Cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project.  In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today's S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent."
673,August 2016,roadburner,"My BMW dealer is setting up a satellite location to sell and service CPO cars- although service for other BMWs will still be offered there, the focus will be on CPO cars."
674,August 2016,dino001,"The issue is, a non-related entity could also offer authorized service, at least in theory.  Service does not have to be tied to sales.  In this case, a Buick dealer could offer Cadillac service in small town.  Or even it could be an completely independent provider, as long as the certification process is transparent and demanding enough.   Unless there are some franchise laws, preventing such decoupling.  Looking what kind of BS Tesla faced in some states, you never know."

677,August 2016,stickguy,quite a large boat.  Definitely won't be on my shopping list.
678,August 2016,Michaell,"And, with a starting price north of $60K, probably out of your budget, too."
679,August 2016,stickguy,"well yeah, unless they want to lease me one for $300/mo. S&D, just to get some on the road."
680,August 2016,kyfdx,I can't see why they would turn that deal down!
681,August 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"I'm guessing they will depreciate heavily, so if you want one, just hang out a few years."
682,August 2016,stickguy,"well, I do like to think of myself as a trend setter.  So maybe if I offer to put a decal on it, and talk it up here?"
683,August 2016,brian125,My neighbor just bought a loaded  2016 V-6 Genesis .   The new electronic 3 mode  suspension  is Eon's  better than my  13 R-Spec Genesis. She is coming out of a 2012 E350. She loves the Genesis . I have 15k on mine and really enjoy this   429 h/p  RWD model. Hyundai's 17 speaker 7.1 surround sound Lexicon system is special. Maybe  a tab below the Levinson or  Acura's  ELS system.  .  I would consider buying a left over 2017 or CPO at the end of 2017. I would go for the V-6  that's plenty fast for me these days
684,August 2016,tlong,What does a well-used Phateon go for these days? Lol.
685,August 2016,nyccarguy,"my budget, your budget, &"
686,August 2016,Michaell,True enough.
687,June 2016,brian125,I like the lines on this S90 looks sharp. love the blue  color.  I'm not a fan of any 4cyl / turbo  in a car this heavy. I'd like to put this S90 up against the 17 Hyundai Genesis. I'd think in the looks dept. Volvo has the Genesis beat.
688,June 2016,andys120,There's something familiar about that styling>
689,June 2016,flightnurse,"So stopped by the MB dealer and looked at the GLC and the new C Class coupe, liked the GLC a big improvement over the GLK it replaced.. Now the car that really blew me away was the new C- coupe looks like a mini S coupe MB had a home run with this car, didn't drive it, just wanted to look at it."
690,June 2016,stickguy,my son drove a C class coupe friday.  I rode in the back (won't do that again).  He was in lust with it.  Impressive car if yuo want a 2 door.
691,June 2016,andres3,"Drove up Palomar mountain hauling donkey butt today.  At the top met a nice young couple in a '03 Honda S2000 with 95,000 miles that he said he got a couple thousand miles ago for 10 grand.  Last of the 9K redline units he said.  Bumble bee yellow with black interior, top down.  He said it was only 2,500 pounds and was riding on 255/??R17 Enkei lightweight wheels on extreme summer tires.  Also saw a Ferrari club arrive just after I did going up the other direction that I chose.  Included a McClaren and Maserati in the group."
692,June 2016,flightnurse,"I miss Palomar, I always liked the east side best, always had breakfast at Mothers at the top."
693,June 2016,andres3,
694,June 2016,sandman_6472,"Drove a previous generation MB GLK, 2015, today at work. Loved the way it drove though not a big fan of driving a box around. Great engine with shift points that were so unobtrusive, I had to look at the tach a few times to make sure the car was indeed changing gears...totally seemless and quiet, was a real pleasure to drive and would be very happy to have a CPO model as my daily driver. Sure the mpg's are in the toilet but one doesn't purchase any luxury vehicle like this to get econocar gas mileage. Just like the maintenance, one just knows going in that driving these type of vehicles will cost more but it definitely is worth it for anyone who loves the automobile!"
695,June 2016,flightnurse,So Car and Driver have a couple of interesting short take test drive
696,July 2016,flightnurse,So it appears BMW will be bring over a 4 door 2 series for MY2018 I guess they think that segment will grow
697,July 2016,benjaminh,"In the unlikely event anyone here would consider an Acura TLX as their entry-level luxury car, right now Edmunds is offering an exclusive $1500 incentive on that car. Once that's applied, I think someone could get a base 2016 TLX for close to the price of an Accord EXL, c. 26k. I considered this option, but ultimately decided the Accord EX was good enough for me, and it can be had for c. 3k less. Anyway, below, I think, is a link for the TLX incentive..."
698,July 2016,stickguy,I am considering it. In 15 months. Not sure it will last that long.
699,July 2016,flightnurse,"BMW currently has some insane residual value on leases of 2016 5 series. 67% on 10K/36 month lease, 66% on a 12K/36 and 65% on 15K/36 month,"
700,July 2016,Michaell,"And if you use MSD to buy down the MF, you can end up with a pretty amazing lease payment."
701,July 2016,roadburner,"In a bit over two months I'll have 90 days in, so I'm hoping BMW FS still has some attractive leases on something I find interesting..."
702,July 2016,tlong,"Re: the TLX, I had a 2005 TL that I sold recently at 156K miles. The TLX is the newer incarnation of that car, and with the somewhat improved appearance, I'm wondering why it seems the TLX doesn't sell anything like the '04-10-ish one did. I know it got ugly with the beak but it seems that it is at least decent looking now."
703,July 2016,benjaminh,"I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland."
704,July 2016,kyfdx,"I think that's it.   They thought they could cover both the TL and the TSX market with one car, two different engines, but it's not working."
705,July 2016,graphicguy,"Agreed.  Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX.  Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss.  ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly."
706,July 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, but doesn't MSD sort of contradict why you lease in the first place?"
707,July 2016,kyfdx,"Sort of... but, you get the money back at lease end.   It's too good of a deal to pass up, in most cases.  (even if the purpose of a lease is to not tie up a wad of cash)."
708,July 2016,dino001,"Not really.  Since it's a deposit, you get the money back.  Since it lowers the MF, it can be seen as earning interest on the money.  So if you take 7xSD, lowering MF on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition).  Translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money.  MSD is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction).  Not even close.  Don't put money down on lease, but MSD - good deal, IMHO."
709,July 2016,qbrozen,3 whole years with the same car? Perish the thought.
710,July 2016,graphicguy,I like seeing old reviews by MotorWeek.  Found this one last night.  Seems as if Acura's current perceived value issues have deep roots.....
711,July 2016,andres3,"Well, the '04+ TL was many great things:"
712,July 2016,flightnurse,"Yes, this is a great way to lower payments, however, more people don't have an extra 4K sitting around."
713,July 2016,flightnurse,"You get the MSD back at the end of your lease, PLUS save about $50/m on your lease, so that averages out about $1900 on a 3 yr lease. So it's a win/win for you and BMW gets to use the MSD for 3 yrs. You are buying down the money factor of your lease, this where is where you get the saving from."
714,July 2016,brian125,If I remember correctly. Buying 1 MSD point  down  up to  Seven is .000007 going to 000049 on the MF. The only Cons I see is coming up with the extra cash. If your car is totaled or stolen that money is still secure. If you flip your vehicle before lease is up who ever assumes it has to pay you your MSD money. Where can you make 1500 to 2000 dollars profit on that initial upfront  investment in 3 yrs??  Its a good deal
715,July 2016,kyfdx,"That's correct on a BMW, just take one zero out of each number.    .00007 and .00049"
716,July 2016,dino001,"Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car.  But that's probably just my weird math sense."
717,June 2016,flightnurse,"When it comes to transmissions the Premium A4 get's the CVT, if you move up to the Premium Plus and Prestige they get the DSG. I just wish Audi would move to a RWD platform."
718,June 2016,stickguy,"not according to their site.  Looks like DSG on the premium too, FWD or AWD."
719,June 2016,nyccarguy,
720,June 2016,flightnurse,"I'm going out on a limb and saw that that isn't correct, every 2017 A4 that North Scottsdale Audi has, has a CVT transmission, the salesmen said that the Premium gets the CVT and the DSG on the other models."
721,June 2016,flightnurse,"A lot of people aren't happy that the MT is on it's way out, but the current crop of DSG and Auto transmissions really make it hard for people not to agree, I love the 8 spd in our BMW's"
722,June 2016,andres3,"DSG might not have the smoothest of shifting characteristics, particularly at low or stopping speed, but when you can bang out consistent 4-1/2 second OR LESS 0-60 sprints in part due to the brilliant ""launch control"" features of the DSG, how can one honestly complain?"
723,June 2016,roadburner,I'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actually
724,June 2016,nyccarguy,"Just poking around, I am noticing a few brand new 2015 leftover S4s still sitting on dealer lots.  What gives?  Is there no lease support, so the 2016s (which you can lease) are moving off the lots?"
725,June 2016,flightnurse,"RR even in the M3 and M4 the DSG are wonderful, just as you said you can go from Cruise mode to toy mode with a push of a button. It's like having two cars in one. Some years back Rick had a Mini convertible as a rental it was the non turbo model, and that car could not get out of it's own way, a MT was needed in that car."
726,June 2016,Michaell,"Audi has dropped lease support on all 2015's, making them more expensive to lease than the 2016's."
727,June 2016,nyccarguy,"I just spent a few minutes building my own Audis on the Audi Website.  There hasn't been a vehicle out within reason in quite a few years that I actually cared enough to look, so hats off to Audi.  They caught my discerning eye."
728,June 2016,nyccarguy,I saw a gorgeous WHITE S3 tonight!
729,June 2016,breld,There's a white S3 parked outside our office building these days - I agree it's very sharp with the contrasting black panoramic sunroof.
730,June 2016,flightnurse,"So Friday my local BMW dealer had a driving event, Drive for the Cause, it was held on friday and of course no one was there for it at 11am, so Rick and I had all the cars to ourselves. They had 650i GC, 550i sedan, 4289GC, X1,X3, X5 40e (plug in) they also  has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the M Sport performance parts. I drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, X5 and X1. First time driving the 650iGC and I loved it, It handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, M Sport, Executive package, B&O radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the TT V8 is a monster, and I would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and I wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the TTV8! The X5 40e was a complete surprise it was comfortable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did I feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2L gas engine was peppy enough to move the big X5 without much problem, very refined.. The X1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the X1 was going to impress me or Rick after driving the other 3 cars, the X1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then I thought it was going to be."
731,June 2016,cdnpinhead,"Couldn't imagine why the masses didn't show up to drive cars in 115 degree heat.  Oh wait, maybe I can."

734,June 2016,flightnurse,Yes they do
735,June 2016,stickguy,"I walked a row at the BMW dealer today (some of their new cars).  Had to read the backs to figure out what was what.  So many looked not all that much different from each other. 2's at least were coupes.  But the 3, 4 GT, GCs, all blurred together."
736,June 2016,nyccarguy,
737,June 2016,flightnurse,"Interesting wasn't aware there was a 4GT, that would have stood out, but then again, 3 series is a sedan and a 4 series is a coupe, they all look alike I guess"
738,June 2016,flightnurse,"There you go, the stars are trying to tell you to get a 6 series..."
739,June 2016,stickguy,maybe I mixed that up in the alphabet soup.  Might have been 4 GC and 3 GT.  they don't make it easy to keep straight.
740,June 2016,nyccarguy,"Lol!  I'd have to wait for you & Rick to buy a moderately priced 640i GC X-Drive (my wife prefers blue), and then buy it from you second hand for somewhere less than 50% of the car's original MSRP when you are done with it!"
741,June 2016,nyccarguy,
742,June 2016,flightnurse,"Yes the N63 (engine code) has had problems and it appears BMW has a fix, the truly sad part really is, Audi and MB both have TT V8 and don't have problems with theirs. I had thought about a 550 in the past but after researching the N63 issues and the factory fix, I'm not totally convinced they have it fixed. Here are a could of threads on Bimmerfest regarding the N63 engine problems."
743,June 2016,flightnurse,"Stick, the same can be said about Audi, MB, Infiniti, Lexus if one really isn't into a brand then  yes all the cars even sedans and coupes look a like.."
744,June 2016,flightnurse,"Forgot to answer this, I have 47K miles on El Cheapo and never had a mechanical issue with it, of that 39K or so is with the Stage 1."
745,June 2016,flightnurse,"So here is a short write up on the new Volvo S90, very promising."
746,June 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Their Series 5 BMW competitor really needed an upgrade like that. The older S80 had a horrendous depreciation rate.  Losing 58% of your car's value in 3 years isn't an encouragement to buy.
747,May 2016,breld,I do extended test drives all the time.
748,May 2016,flightnurse,How about expanding on this then just say you do it...  What manufacture allows and what is an extended test drive to you?
749,May 2016,brian125,"Ray Catena MB, Bmw, Audi, Maserati  in  NJ will let you take one of there pre assigned Audi's, MB or BMW, Maserati  for a good part of the day. Some of these cars , Suv's are upper management  Vehicles.  Not many  dealers will let you have a vehicle like this that long.  I have a long standing with Catena.  I call in  the morning  tell them what I want to drive and its never been a problem.  They treat there customers like gold."
750,May 2016,flightnurse,Is a day really an extended test drive?  But its nice to know that there is a dealership willing to give customers a car like this
751,May 2016,breld,I was just making a joke regarding my habit of buying and trading cars more often than I should.
752,May 2016,Michaell,I was just making a joke regarding my habit of buying and trading cars more often than I should.
753,May 2016,stickguy,Even an hour drive can tell you way more than 5 minutes around the block
754,May 2016,kyfdx,"Last time we shopped multiple makes/dealers, we had plenty of them offer to give us the car overnight.    Actually took one of them up on it, as my wife hates going to car dealers, and the car was for her."
755,May 2016,henryn,"If you’re contemplating a fairly mainstream vehicle, you can often rent one from Hertz or Enterprise.  Toyota Camry, Chevy Impala, Chrysler Town and Country, no problem.  If you’re looking at a Jaguar or Land Rover, well, a lot harder."
756,May 2016,Mr_Shiftright,
757,May 2016,graphicguy,"Interesting take!  At the end of the day, if the enthusiast really wants one of these cars, it's still going to knock on the door of high $40s or low $50s to get one to perform the way we'd expect."
758,May 2016,qbrozen,"Some dumb entries in there, IMHO. First, how do you have 2 different ""entry-level"" BMWs. Entry level is 1 level only. If they were close on price, I suppose I could see the argument, but the 4 GC is $8k more for starters. My other problem is the inclusion of a VW. Audi takes their luxo sales slot."
759,May 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Well you know the argument...the highest trim level of the lower price brand approximates the stripper model of the next higher level brand.
760,May 2016,qbrozen,"I'm sure it is a nice car and all, but if you gotta go to the top of the brand's offerings, then you completely leave out the ""entry level"" part of the equation."
761,May 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Well you know car mags are always stretching definitions so that they can concoct yet another story for yet another issue.
762,June 2016,nyccarguy,Like the edmunds 340i with a multitude of options that make it a $60K 3 series?

768,June 2016,sda,Has anyone heard from markincincinati?  I think his last post was in February.
769,June 2016,cdnpinhead,"Good question.  He cut way back a few years ago, possibly due to having to spend much more time on his business, but I don't remember him being gone this long before."
770,June 2016,graphicguy,FN...would be interested in your take on the new A4.
771,June 2016,nyccarguy,Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.
772,June 2016,flightnurse,"So the test drive went well, just a little FYI, it was 110 today here in Sunny PHX..."
773,June 2016,andres3,Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.
774,June 2016,stickguy,"I thought the A4 was using the normal AT, not the dual clutch box?  Which is fine by me for one of these!"
775,June 2016,andres3,"I think the '17 A4 has simply gone standard dual clutch auto, at least in Quattro form, but I haven't seen one in person very closely yet, nor driven one."
776,June 2016,stickguy,"looks like you are correct.  Must be confusing it with the old style, but looks like the A4 is DSG, though the site just mentions base FWD, I'm sure it is the same with Quattro."
777,May 2016,andres3,"Oh goodie, Audi got added to the previously only High-end list."
778,May 2016,qbrozen,Someone posted this on the Caddy board I frequent. It is a really good interview. He is an impressive individual with all the right answers.
779,May 2016,nyccarguy,"A lot of noise was made on the boards here when Acura replaced everybody's beloved TL with ""the beak"" with the 2009 redesign.  It was too much and way to aggressive.  The 2012 facelift was subsequently criticized for being too conservative.  I happen to be in the minority.  I like the old TL Type S which is still a great looking car close to 10 years out of production.  I like the 2009 - 2011 SH AWD models because of their aggressive looking rear end with tail pipes sticking out the back & squared off 5 Spoke Wheels.  I also dig the look of the 2012 - 2014 SH AWD models.  Many people also don't like the sea of black, white, silver, & grey ELLPS out there.  Check out what I saw on the way home yesterday."
780,May 2016,kyfdx,"I saw a previous generation yesterday. (2004-2008?), TL-S model.     Was thinking about how nice that body style holds up.."
781,May 2016,graphicguy,That TL is a total respray.  That's not a color Acura offers in the TL.
782,May 2016,nyccarguy,I know it the car was repainted & that's not a stock Acura color.  I just thought it stands out.
783,May 2016,stickguy,"I am still fond of the TLX, and it is on the list for next year.  But would get a 4 cyl DCT"
784,May 2016,sda,"After dad gave me his clean 95 Cutlass Ciera because he could no longer drive, I drove it for about 2 years and sold my 01 Aurora 4.0.  When the Ciera needed expensive a/c repair, I cut bait, and it was a great excuse to get another car.  I bought a very clean 03 Acura TL with 20k, silver, black interior.  This was in 05.  For some reason, the TL just hit me as being blah, nothing special, though the V6 felt and sounded great.   I guess I should have bought the TL-S instead.  Enter black 06 Passat 2.0t---a fun and nice driving car.  Like stickguy, I have my eye on a TLX w/tech as a possible future purchase."
785,May 2016,flightnurse,"I received a phone call from Scottsdale Jaguar, they have the new XE in, will be stopping by today to look at them, they have 5, 4 base and 1 premium. I'll have to look at the F-Pace too."

787,May 2016,breld,"I like those too - test drove one a while back and was impressed with the package overall.  In my area, the dealers have some low mileage 4 cyl tech models (loaners probably) for right at $30k or a bit under.  As I like to say, lot of car for the money."
788,May 2016,benjaminh,"Perhaps I'm the only one, but I like how Acura has gone back to its tagline from the 1990s: ""Precision Crafted Performance."""

796,May 2016,carnaught,Boo!
797,May 2016,flightnurse,"So went to the Jaguar Dealer, I was much more impressed with the F-Pace then I was with the XE. The XE still has a tight rear legroom then my F30 or Ricks F34. But the F-Pace is nice, the one on the showroom did not have real leather, but their fake leather and was impressed with how it felt, very rich feel to it. The 340 hp V6 was nice, pulled strong. The F-Pace is the same size as BMW's X5 and it under cut the X5 by 7K. This was the first time I had a chance to really look at Jaguar up close and the salesman was not pushy at all. The F pace comes in Diesel and Gas, beginning of June they get their first diesel F Pace, I can't wait to drive it. Regarding the XE for a base model, at 34K you get more standard equipment then the 328, A4 and C300, the fit and finish was perfect on the two XE's that I looked it. I hope this is a good sign for Jaguar."
798,May 2016,stickguy,"the F pace is that big?  I thought it was based on the XE, so more along the size of an X3?"
799,May 2016,nyccarguy,
800,May 2016,stickguy,"I thought they drove nice, and were pretty quick.  Or so I have heard."
801,May 2016,flightnurse,"That is what I thought, but the salesperson explained the ""F"" in Pace. The F-pace is based off the XF there will be a E-Pace within the next year. Also something interesting, Look for Jaguar to set up a bank i.e Jaguar Financial Services soon, like like what BMW and MB has done. He explained that they currently use Chase Bank, so lease rates should come down as well as top tier rates for people who have a credit score above 675, this is the cut off for BMW top tier rate."

808,May 2016,stickguy,Volvo has free service for that long at least I believe.  or close to it.  VW offers 1 year (used to be 3).  Or maybe it is 2 now?  They kept changing it.

813,May 2016,benjaminh,What's going on with Cadillac the past few years reminds me a little bit of Oldsmobile in the late 1990s.
814,May 2016,andres3,"BMW includes wear items though, including brakes and wipers I'm told.  However, they do exclude tires."
815,May 2016,roadburner,Wear items are no longer warranted by BMW from 2017 forward.
816,May 2016,dino001,"Wow, what's happening? Why is BMW cutting maintenance and warranty?  This is effectively a price increase.  Looks like pushing the lease even harder than before.  Also seems like a very weak statement about confidence in this new and improved product.  Too many problems with turbo engines? Hoarding cash for a future dieselgate?  What gives?"
817,May 2016,stickguy,"I thought BMW already leased a very high percentage of cars?  If so, makes sense to cut back.  Most likely though it was just a way to shave costs without raising prices, and not something buyers will immediately feel."
818,May 2016,flightnurse,"BMW is selling cars do they don't have to do the free maintenance any longer, but Jag will have to do it for a while to get people to trust them, I'm hoping that Alfa does the same thing with their cars too. It's nice to know you wont have to pay for anything.."
819,May 2016,dino001,"They do, but shortening the coverage will make them even more dependent on leases.  I'm sure a good extension and certified preowned programs coukd bridge the gap.  I just hate ""sneak"" price hikes, like changing the packaging, or cutting 0.2 inches of width from paper towel or toilet tissue rolls.  I like straight talk and treatment, not slight of hand moves."
820,May 2016,sda,"That would be sad as Olds was shut down.  Doubt they would do that to Cadillac, but never say never."
821,May 2016,kyfdx,"As much as those that really look at the math (like you and me) value the maintenance program, BMW decided that the marketing value of the plan didn't justify their increased costs.    They are probably correct.    Unfortunately."
822,May 2016,cdnpinhead,"Maybe BMW will go back to maintenance schedules that help the car last hundreds of thousands of miles, as long as they don't have to pay for it.  I'm not holding my breath, however."
823,May 2016,stickguy,not happening as long as they are paying for it.
824,May 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Maybe BMW has confidence that their cars are now more reliable than they used to be?
825,May 2016,sandman_6472,"Saw a beautiful 328i, blue over beige, not sure the year but gorgeous. Having never owned a BMW, will definitely be looking for a CPO unit in a few years once I go into retirement again. By then, my driving should go down substantially so it'll be mostly around town stuff. Just wish they still made the 128 as I love the smaller size, anything from 170"" down is my preferred size now as it's usually me in the vehicle or me and the wife as the kids usually meet us in their own rides or we take a couple to our destination."
826,May 2016,andres3,"If I didn't know a great Indy Audi Shop then I might feel differently about the value of free maintenance.  Also, if the car is totaled early in its life, I don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back.  So it could end up being worthless."
827,May 2016,dino001,"By cutting the warranty?  I don't follow. Maintenance is one thing, but warranty is another."
828,May 2016,kyfdx,I hadn't heard that the warranty was being cut.... just the maintenance.
829,May 2016,dino001,"I tried to corroborate and found a confirmation for the maintenance cut and couple of dealers listing new 2017 vehicles with 4/50 warranty and 3/36 maintenance.  Looks, like I might have misunderstood.  I thought Fligthnurse wrote about both warranty and maintenance being cut, but perhaps not."
830,May 2016,flightnurse,"IT's not to take effect until MY17, Only the maintenance is being cut not the bumper to bumper warranty, however, I think the bumper to bumper warranty isn't transferable since My16."
831,May 2016,dino001,"I think it's the maintenance that's not transferable.  Warranty is - essentially all brands have warranty transferable, except there are some exceptions in Kia/Hyundai ""extensions"" in warranties beyond 3/36, but I don't know the details on those exceptions."
832,May 2016,graphicguy,"Trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but BMW saved themselves a ton of money.  Probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some AWD services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things.  But, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined."
833,May 2016,Michaell,"And, given that a majority of BMWs are leased for 36 months, I don't think they are offending that segment of their customers by dropping the 4th year."
834,May 2016,kyfdx,"Not covering wear items at all, from what I understand, so no wipers or brake jobs.  I've received brake jobs on at least one axle, on every BMW we've had."
835,May 2016,dino001,"That's why I'm so disappointed.  3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based.  My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently.  There may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition."

843,May 2016,kyfdx,Spotted an STS-V on Monday.   That has to be pretty rare.
844,May 2016,roadburner,I don't know what Cadillac is going to do; they have a world class product but perception is taking much too long to catch up with reality...
845,May 2016,laurasdada,"Perhaps review their pricing model, study Lexus circa 1989..."
846,May 2016,roadburner,Exactly; they need to get butts in seats before they set prices as high as their competitors.
847,May 2016,dino001,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels.  It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network.  They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market."
848,May 2016,nyccarguy,The sad thing is that Cadillac HAS good products.  Between
849,May 2016,dino001,"It may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what Cadillac thinks they should pay.  So either the cars stay on lots, or they move at prices below expected levels.  Something's got to give.  Mere wishing is not going to solve it - yet, so far that's all we see from them - trying to charm reality with corporate chants, not real moves."
850,May 2016,jpp5862,"I completely agree, but they spent 30+ years destroying the brand, it won't recover overnight."
851,May 2016,graphicguy,Lots of truth in your last paragraph!
852,May 2016,nyccarguy,Well said
853,May 2016,qbrozen,"couldn't agree more. No idea why they just don't lower their prices. I mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests AND undercut their prices. You lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point."
854,May 2016,dino001,"Simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more.  Moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount.  Not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer.   Last - they still think ""It's a Cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."
855,May 2016,flightnurse,CG what has happened with your CTS? Had Caddy made good on fixing it?
856,May 2016,graphicguy,"FN...Cadillac took the '14 CTS back.  I was still PO'd but they gave me a new '16 and some pocket money for my troubles.  '16 is what the '14 should have been.  CTS came out of the blocks about 18 months before it was fully baked, at least in my case."
857,May 2016,laurasdada,"""For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars. """

861,May 2016,qbrozen,"Where in the interior do you find it lacking? Just doing a quick comparo online, the CTS has 4.4"" more front legroom than the E and 4.3"" more than the 5. It falls right in the middle with rear legroom at only 0.4"" less than the E but 0.1"" more than the 5."
862,May 2016,laurasdada,"The Jag F-Pace, like the XE, is getting very good early press. Automobile Mag (online, at least) has a ""first and second"" drive impression articles, they're still looking for faults."
863,May 2016,flightnurse,"Congrats on the new car, is this one a 4 cyl or 6 cyl?"
864,May 2016,flightnurse,"I like the  XF will give it a look, should have written that."
865,May 2016,andres3,They need to do something unconventional to win back the trust.
866,May 2016,andres3,A 10 year warranty with a guaranteed loaner/rental when needed would help speed that along.
867,March 2016,flightnurse,"Depending where you live there are some great deals on BMWs right now. my neighbor just leased a 2015 535d new, MSRP $77K, purchase price $59K, with the 3K lease money BMW has his money payments on this car is $525/m with ZERO out of pocket. He got the car from Pacific BMW in Glendale, Ca. They have a huge selection of cars from new with zero miles, to service loaners to Exec cars."
868,March 2016,circlew,Here is a good lease on a 335i
869,March 2016,Michaell,"It's OK .. over $5K due at signing, but you'll get the $3850 back at the end. Oh, plus DMV and dealer fee costs, whatever those happen to be."
870,March 2016,nyccarguy,"Not to mention that this has got to be for 10K miles per year (so what do I drive for the other 6 months?).  So after 3 years you'll have paid out over $19,000 in lease payments (plus tax).  I think they are marking up the bank fee by $200."
871,March 2016,kyfdx,"$925 is the new standard acquisition fee for BMWFS.     No markups allowed, now."
872,March 2016,nyccarguy,I stand corrected!
873,March 2016,flightnurse,"That isn't a very good deal, I'm sure you would walk into the dealership and get it for less. Also With that payment the MF isn't at the base rate. The GT's aren't selling that well."
874,March 2016,Michaell,
875,March 2016,Mr_Shiftright,You're also losing one month's lease payment in the investment interest you would lose on giving them $3850 of your money for 3 years.
876,March 2016,flightnurse,"This is one area where the dealer makes money, other then the lovely Doc Fee"
877,March 2016,parachautopart,"its seems difficult to decide, seriously."
878,April 2016,flightnurse,"One thing people don't get with MSD's is over the life of the lease, you are saving on average about $1900 plus you get the MSD's back when you turn the car"
879,April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah but the dealer can jack up the MF, and if they do that to the max as Michael points out, that's one whole 1% more interest;  and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage (read the fine print) --not a great position for negotiation  at turn-in."
880,April 2016,stickguy,"that was something I wondered about with the MSDs.  On my lease, there is no security deposit, so if they want to ding me for damage, they have to ask for it and I can argue.  But if they have $3,500 ""on account"", they can keep whatever they want, and I would have to fight them to get it back."
881,April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,EGG-xactly my concern as well.
882,April 2016,flightnurse,"This can happen and does at any dealership, but this is why the savvy buyer would investigate what the current MF is and call the dealer on the increase."
883,April 2016,flightnurse,"From what I have read on Bimmerfest, BMW has not done this since the MSD is not really a ""security"" deposit in the general term, but a way to lower the MF."
884,April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Depends on what's in the contract--it should state (or not) whether the MSD can be used against damages at turn-in.
885,April 2016,kyfdx,"I agree with the thought process on this... It's the same reason I don't use a debit card.   But, in reality, all cars get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in).   You owe what you owe, regardless of deposit."
886,April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"True enough but there are shades of gray as to what represents ""significant damage"". I've also heard of cases where one inspection seeeds rather perfunctory, and another very  detailed. Go figure."
887,April 2016,kyfdx,"I haven't run into that.   Twice was with MSDs, but I've turned in at least 8-10 leased cars, with never an issue."
888,April 2016,flightnurse,"I was going to post something like this, I would suspect that it all depends on how much reconditioning your car needs, if you take care of your car and it's just normal wear and tear, then it's not an issue, but if you don't care how many stains there are inside or scraps and dents and road rash on the rims, then I get could see BMW holding back some money."
889,April 2016,tlong,"I had a rented A3 sedan this past week. I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed. While I realize it was probably a base model, the interior, while nice, had quite a bit of hard door plastics, etc. IMHO the dash looks kind of cheap with the worst part being the round air vents. The driving feel was ok but not great. The engine (I assume it was a Turbo 4?) was somewhat harsh at idle but had good power upon acceleration. The leather seats were decent and the car looks attractive."
890,April 2016,andres3,"Can't argue with you that it seems Audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation  A3's interior.  I love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement.  The driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me.  The 1.8T I'm not a fan of; the 2.0T should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time.  Before someone argues, note the 2.0T adds quattro without losing MPG, that's better efficiency by a large margin.  The 2.0T is a stellar engine."
891,April 2016,tlong,"I couldn't toss it as I pretty much drove the freeways. Also my rental seemed to bottom out the front right shock as if there was no damping - it was a huge chunk on speedbumps, etc. So I had to baby it a bit - but the car had 18K miles on it so don't know how that had happened. I reported it to the rental company upon return."
892,April 2016,andres3,I wonder when rental companies will start installing dash cams into the cars to see just how abused rentals are during rental periods.
893,April 2016,kyfdx,The Quattro version comes with a more powerful engine...
894,April 2016,sandman_6472,"We love our A3 with the 1.8T engine to be honest. Not one problem so far, only has been back to the dealer for their gratis wash/vacuum. Our first time going german and we are very pleased. So pleased in fact, that 12 days later, I went to our local VW store and bought a Golf hatch for myself. Had less cash to spend and wanted the versatility of a hatch to haul stuff. So far, only one issue with a starter wire that took a few days to find malfunctioning. But after a couple of days, the problem finally showed itself and that was that. Also, the lumbar handle came off twice and now fixed perfectly."
895,April 2016,andres3,"Do you know if your wife's A3 is still made in Germany (VIN start with W), and the Golf probably made in Mexico (VIN number starts with 3 I think).  After solving the Mexican teething quality control issues, I""m sure your Golf will serve you as well as any Honda for reliability and durability."

901,February 2016,roadburner,"I liked the M2, but it wasn't within my current budget. That said, at the M2's price point the GT350 is a compelling alternative. I'd have to spend considerable seat time in both to make the call."
902,February 2016,flightnurse,"Having just driven a M3, Mustang GT and GT350 back to back, I give it to the GT350, for me it hits all the right points. Plus the sound that V8 makes is erotic (to me.) When I'm ready for next car it's going to be tough to choose."
903,February 2016,nyccarguy,
904,February 2016,roadburner,"A major selling point for the GT350 is the flat plane V8- it's significantly different from the Mustang GT engine. As for as price goes, the GT350 has the edge on paper; the trick is finding a dealer that actually has a car to sell- and isn't tacking on a $25k ADM sticker..."
905,February 2016,nyccarguy,"I can't stand ADM stickers, but there are morons who pay them so who am I to judge?  I actually know 2 people who paid them."
906,February 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"So he paid what? Maybe $60K?...and 9 years later it's worth 1/2 that---not too bad, really, even with the ADM."
907,February 2016,nyccarguy,The guy with the Shelby?  I guess not.
908,February 2016,flightnurse,"You can order a M3/M4 that comes in under the 65K mark, the only option I would get on them is M Adapative Suspension, for 1K that is it. But the GT350 fully loaded in far less then that. When it comes to the ADM well just wait, that will go away too."

The resemblance to the great E46 doesn't hurt either.  Like you I've given some thought to various Mustangs but they're just to big for me.  I wonder if they've improved the weight  distribution.  My '86 5 liter  convertible was as front heavy as an unloaded pickup."

916,February 2016,roadburner,"I hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers. Maybe I've just been lucky, but when I creased the side of my ti I took it to my local dealer's BMW Certified Collision Repair Center. The quality of the work was outstanding, and I had absolutely no complaints. Was the body shop that ""repaired"" your car an Audi certified shop?"
917,February 2016,andres3,"Yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of San Diego County!

938,January 2016,dino001,"I think at low end it is quicker than it feels, but once the ratios change at higher speeds, it really is sluggish.  But it can be worse - new Chrysler 200 I drove recently was just awful at highway speeds."
939,January 2016,sandman_6472,"NY, now you know why I really really like our A3, t really is a nice looking vehicle. Ours being the base model with the extra safety features besides the back-up camera the wife had to have, it's a great package. It feels like a more expensive vehicle than it is the minute you open the door. As much as I like my Golf, like the A3 even more and the white over black is nice, not a combo I'd choose though. Luckily, she's keeping the mileage down so when the time is right, I'd still have a lower mileage A3."

941,January 2016,andres3,Acura needs a TLX-S with the better 3.7 (vs. 3.5) tuned up to 330+ HP with proper transmission choices.  Or maybe they could turbocharge the old gem of a 3.0 V6.

947,February 2016,tlong,"That's one reason that even though I love driving German cars, I've just had enough of their service and parts prices. Over the years the amount of actual service needed in cars has gone way down - I remember the '70's where I had to replace plugs, oil, adjust valves, timing, replace points and condenser - every 6K miles! It was a VW Bug. But in those days that service at an independent cost like $60. Today you do almost none of those things and yet the service is hundreds of dollars."
948,February 2016,Michaell,$60 in 1975 is about $270 today
949,February 2016,roadburner,One of the main reasons that I have not strayed too far from BMW is the fact that my dealer has an excellent service department and doesn't try to push unnecessary work. I also get a 20% discount on both parts and labor.

Here is the URL for the cars.."
956,February 2016,stickguy,"for a LT relationship, a well-rounded performer with rock solid reliability is not a bad thing to have.  Likely better than one that ""wows"" in one area but comes with a lot of other compromises that can wear on you after a while?"
957,December 2015,andres3,"Yes, I much rely on one car to do it all, and I can't have breakdowns.  I don't have the time or money or patience.   My S4 was fixed same day I took it in; the leaky windshield washer fluid tank was actually a hose that came off of the headlight washer system that attaches to the tank.   Can I blame this on the body shop or Audi?  I think 90% chance the body shop is to blame since the leak was by the front of the car, 10% chance Audi should have made the hoses with better clamps."
958,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Well that 80K marker doesn't mean something outright fails. It means it has become substandard. Many many people drive around quite contentedly with cars, that if subjected to inspection, could justify quite a few repairs. At 80K for instance, your car's struts still work fine, but they aren't anywhere as good as new, and a worn ball joint wouldn't exhibit any difference to the driver. Nor would mushy motor mounts, glazed fan belts, or cracked exhaust hangers."
959,December 2015,m6user,"That 80k mark was probably correct up to about twenty years.  Since the late 90s it seems that has stretched another 30k or so.  Heck, back in 60s and 70s you started having major repairs by 70k and a car over 100k was worth next to nothing."
960,December 2015,stickguy,
961,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, I would expect a new-ish car to still be in pretty good shape at 80K. But parts do wear. Maybe the glove box door is as good at 80K as it was when new but parts that go round and round and up and down have to show wear at 80K.  And don't forget the psychological barrier of 99.9K miles and how that affects resale value. I think there is a mileage or number in people's heads as to when a car is ready for repairs.  Not sure what that number is, but 99,999 sounds about right."
962,December 2015,flightnurse,I have a co-worker who has a first year new Gen camero with 145K miles on it and no major repairs on it. Of course I told him now that he spoke about it openly he will have problems now with it.
963,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,I bet we could find some
964,December 2015,graphicguy,"Perhaps some of that comes from having to replace serpentine belts, timing belts, etc at or near the 100K mile mark?"
965,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes I think that's exactly right---usually 100K, or 90K, or maybe 105K,  is a big service and many people skip out before having to do that.  Also it's not unusual to need tires and brakes at that mileage, which are normal wear items.  I mean, how many sellers would do ALL those things and then sell the car?"
966,December 2015,roadburner,"Well, at the 182,370 mile Oil Service my son's X3 also needed two serpentine belts as well as rear pads and rotors. Oh the horror!!!"
967,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, but not everyone with a miled up X3 has a knowledgeable dad to fix everything, nor do they have your good luck.  Remember, risk assessment is based on an actuarial. If you just interviewed 100 year old men you'd never predict actual life expectancy."
968,December 2015,roadburner,I don't think it's good luck- it's conscientious and consistent maintenance.
969,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"And that too! Of course, for that to really work it helps to buy the car new. I'm also conscientious but I've had to pay for the previous owner's neglect sometimes....or worse yet, for the factory's engineering gaffs."
970,December 2015,roadburner,"Well, the X3 was practically new; it had 16,500 miles on it and was just over a year old. You are absolutely right about prior owners; they can either enhance the reliability or ""poison the pond"" as it were."
971,December 2015,flightnurse,"This is why getting a CPO BMW or any other brand that offers free maintenance is usually a good bet, since the new owner doesn't pay for service and can be in and out of a service department in about 15 minutes."
972,December 2015,sandman_6472,"Am thinking that a CPO luxury level vehicle is the best way to buy one used since the company's have a certain check list of things that must be done besides an oil change and tire rotation. Personally, I'd have more confidence in purchasing a vehicle that has been CPO'd than one that hasn't and would be willing to pay a slight premium for it just knowing the odds are in my favor for a more pleasant ownership experience."
973,December 2015,markcincinnati,"Normally, I would want to address the following quote, amplify it or perhaps even counter the point -- Sandman speaks the truth. Perhaps the intent was to update the Hawthorne effect. You decide.  My experience is that if you are into it/them [cars] you will indeed take better care of them -- and be rewarded with reliability."
974,January 2016,roadburner,"In case anyone is interested, here is the most recent used oil analysis from my wife's X3(yes, she took it back and sent my son to SC in her old E90 328i- neither of us miss it"
975,January 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, some people don't realize that fuel contamination is an engine killer! Coolant contamination is certainly a bearing-eater."

977,January 2016,sweendogy,
978,January 2016,stickguy,"one good thing about the luxo brands is the nice long warranty.  the dealer I have been keeping an eye on has had a number of 2 MY (even some 1 MY) used models, so we are talking 2-3 years elapsed max.  So 1-2 years BtoB + another 2 years powertrain left on it.  So while not certified, still plenty of coverage in case of any bugs it might have when you buy it."
979,January 2016,roadburner,A CPO car is only as good as the certifying dealer; I've bought 3 CPO cars from my local BMW dealer and they were all in excellent shape.
980,January 2016,sweendogy,
981,January 2016,sandman_6472,"I plan to look at Audi, MB and BMW next time and go the CPO route to insure a vehicle that should last a good amount of time. Will pounce on our A3 if she decides to get something else though as her mileage will be pretty low in a few years. If not, leaning towards BMW to see what the fuss is about."
982,January 2016,roadburner,"IMNSHO, your only sure bet to get a newer BMW that actually drives-at least a little-like a traditional BMW is to find a Sport/M Sport 2 Series, 3 Series, or 4 Series."

987,December 2015,markcincinnati,Why would rear brakes be the first to go?  Seems counter-intuitive.
988,December 2015,andres3,Ferodo Street Sport pads.  Expensive? Yes.  Worth it? Yes.
989,December 2015,roadburner,Exactly.
990,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Geez, that's BMW 7-series money."
991,December 2015,stickguy,Honda's for some reason had a phase where the rears wore out much quicker than the front.  I learned this when it happened to my Accord.
992,December 2015,nyccarguy,"Happened in my (former) TSX & our Pilot as well.  It doesn't make sense as the cars are platforms are FWD & the cars are nose heavy.  One service adviser at a Honda dealer told me it is because they put rear brake pads ""the size of oreo cookies"" on the cars."
993,December 2015,sda,"Are there other BMW dealers in your area?  If not, sounds like a captive audience and little chance for getting another quote unless an independent shop does the work."
994,December 2015,sda,"Same with my 06 Passat.  Rear pads replaced around 50k, rotors left intact and didn't need resurfacing.  Not sure this answer was correct but the service advisor told me there was more bias dialed to the rear brakes than in the past to take some of the stress off the front brakes. (?)"
995,December 2015,kyfdx,"Yeah.. my dealer quoted around $600 just to do the rear brakes on my '06 model BMW.    A lot of that is the OEM BMW rotors.   Really, really pricy.      I had my independent do the job with BMW pads and sensor, but with aftermarket rotors.  Saved about half."
996,December 2015,kyfdx,"It does seem that way, but typical for BMWs."
997,December 2015,robr2,"I've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the OEM brake pads on the rear are thinner.  The goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time.  The 2005 Passat I just traded had the rears done at 60K and all four were due to be done when I traded at 135K.  I never did the fronts in that time."
998,December 2015,henryn,My 2008 Passat got new brakes on the rear at around 99k miles.  The fronts were still good when I sold the car at around 105k.
999,December 2015,circlew,A while back we were discussing best engines....here's a new list from Wards 10 Best.

1001,December 2015,sweendogy,I would also guess the rears would wear faster if you lived on a hill and used the parking break a lot - like my wife does. Maybe wrong on this but who knows - 30k miles and have to do rears hurts when you go to a Honda dealer. Glamor shot time
1002,December 2015,nyccarguy,Nice shot!
1003,December 2015,stickguy,"read the review in one of this month's car magazines on the new A4.  Sounded really nice.  Interior though seemed pretty familiar, but I suspect the fancy new dashboard screen is cool."
1004,December 2015,breld,"With the increased hp on the 2.0t and the DSG trannie, the new A4 does seem very competitive."
1005,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,It's certainly getting some nice reviews.
1006,December 2015,flightnurse,Interesting engine choices from Nissan errr Infiniti
1007,December 2015,stickguy,actually sounds like they addressed some of the key issues.  I could be tempted by the 2.0t option!
1008,December 2015,roadburner,"My son brought his 2004 X3 2.5i home from college; it just turned over 182k miles. My wife has been letting him drive her E90 3er while he's home to keep excess miles off his truck. Funny thing; my wife and I both usually prefer light and nimble cars, yet we both like driving his sled more than her E90. I can't put my finger on why exactly- but there it is. Since he's had it at SC it has needed a new battery and a starter, but at that mileage I can't complain too much. The suspension is completely untouched; it's going to the dealer in a couple of days for an Oil Service so we will see if anything needs attention. Even if something does turn up I won't be that upset, as we bought it in 2005 and paid it off in 2007.  It would take a"

1011,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
1012,December 2015,m6user,"A lot of this is situational.  If you have 5 vehicles there is always a spare if one if one or two aren't available.  No long commutes or retired with time to spare.  Most depend greatly on one car and don't have the time or want to hassle with repairs.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand that keeping a car for the very long term is cheaper.  However, money is not the only or even the main factor for many especially those that buy luxury cars."
1013,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Sure it's cheaper because you have amortized the depreciation, and even $150 a month in repairs is 1/2 or 1/3rd a lease or car payment."
1014,December 2015,m6user,Sure it is.....who wants to hassle with repairs whether it's covered by warranty or not.  Number of recalls is also a factor.  Sure it gets fixed for free but can be a hassle if not done during routine maintenence.
1015,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"And then there are the dreadful cases of the dealer being unable to fix the car, even under warranty, or it requiring numerous attempts."
1016,December 2015,tlong,"My experiences don't match that - I usually don't find significant repair costs until around 120K, My Acura TL (2005) is at 155K right now and I had my first significant repair at around 130K, which was $1300 for some suspension work (control arms, etc.). And that has been about it other than the routine stuff. I also had a Jetta go to 143K, an Accord go way over 100K with no issues, and a Mercury Villager with the first big repair around 170K."
1017,December 2015,stickguy,331 at the wheels isn't enough?  Is everyone big daddy Don Garlits now?
1018,December 2015,roadburner,331 hp at the wheels is decent but nothing extraordinary.
1019,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Less than one wants, more than one needs."
1020,December 2015,flightnurse,Please tell us how numbers can be conjurer?
1021,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Seems like you can add in a correction factor prior to the pull or you can mess with  the pressure sensors. Some types of dynos would be easier to cheat on than others of course.   Dynos, after all, are a major sales tool."
1022,December 2015,flightnurse,"So you can't point to any one company but you are willing to post that we shouldn't trust these dyno runs because of ""possible"" issues? I highly doubt that BMS will post wrong info, they aren't a big company that could hire a PR firm to undo the damage of such wrong claims."
1023,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I never implied anything of the sort with BMS.  Advising people to research data from impartial sources rather than the manufacturer seems like good advice to me, whether it's ""lasts three times as long as leading deodorant"" or ""highest interest CD available today"".  Consumer Reports built an empire on this very principle.  If a manufacturer's claims are substantiated they are rewarded."
1024,December 2015,flightnurse,"Did you read the article that I posted?  I don't think you did.... It was a Beta test, more testing to come."
1025,December 2015,flightnurse,Well since BMW quotes the power of the 340 to be at 320hp. I would think 331 is a excellent number.
1026,December 2015,roadburner,"It is a good number compared to the advertised hp, but 331 hp isn't all that extraordinary compared to a lot of other performance cars on the market. stickguy's comment made it sound as it 331 hp is some astronomical power number and it just"

1028,December 2015,andres3,"I guess my sarcasm didn't come across.  I agree, a leaky washer fluid tank is hardly anything to worry about.  If that's the only thing that goes wrong in 37K miles, that's pretty excellent in my book."
1029,December 2015,flightnurse,I'm sure since the product is in beta testing we shall see more numbers to come.
1030,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Swinging back to the topic of shopping entry level performance cars (but not forgetting what we were knocking about), I personally don't pay too much attention to numbers when shopping for a car. As many car enthusiasts know, there is a ""car's numbers"" and there's ""how a car performs in the real world"", and those two things can be very different."

1037,December 2015,markcincinnati,"Agree regarding finding a well qualified shop -- one that specializes in your brand, for these cars are breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair after the OEM warranty/""free"" service period expires."
1038,December 2015,roadburner,"At my BMW dealer I get a 20%  discount on service as well as the parts and accessories I pick up for DIY projects. My Mazda dealer usually has a coupon I can use, and of course they also gave me free oil changes for as long as I own the car. I also have a few indie shops I can use that do excellent work."
1039,December 2015,sweendogy,Thank you community for the answers - much appreciated. I will look Indi as I have a service due in another 3500 miles or so. Has any Audi or s4 owner had to do brakes yet? Or BMW person ? If so mileage at time of service would be appreciated

1043,December 2015,markcincinnati,I've had two A6's have their brakes replaced and I have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's SQ5 and my S4.  She has over 50K on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new REAR brakes in less than 10K miles from now. Not sure what that means with respect to when the FRONT brakes would need replacing.
1044,December 2015,roadburner,"They fed you a line; when my BMW dealer replaced the rear pads on my son's X3 at 132,214 miles I was told that the rear rotor thickness was within BMW specs and replacement was not required."
1045,December 2015,markcincinnati,For ALL FOUR WHEELS?
1046,December 2015,markcincinnati,"Clarification -- new rotors were only required, so they said, if the pads were being replaced.  Can't imagine what other conditions besides a brake rotor and/or brake pad replacement are even possible.  The good news, they did it at no charge."

When it comes to leasing, a 328i with the same packages as the 320i, will lease for less money or slightly more. So the 328i over all is a better value."
1055,December 2015,dino001,"But some people want to have it just the way it is - for them this mix of performance, reliability and gas mileage is just right, not some chipped stuff. Want more performance (power, suspension), less mileage, more wear (on tires, brakes) and lower factor of safety, got pay up, plain and simple."

My M6 received a Dinan chip while my Club Sport has a Turner/Conforti chip; it has over 140k on it. My MS3 makes over 60 hp more than stock via a Mazdaspeed intake and a Hypertech tune- and it has 157k on it."
1059,December 2015,dino001,"You say that, but yor statement violates basic principles of engineering.  You essentially say you found a way to get something for nothing, no energy in, more energy out, by a wave of a wand.  I wish I could do it in structural design, but I can't."
1060,December 2015,roadburner,"My MS3 gets the same mileage as it did prior to installing the tune; there's no magic involved- the tune modifies the ignition advance, fueling, and boost primarily at higher rpm and throttle openings. At cruise the car is running on what is essentially the stock map, with perhaps a bit more spark advance dialed in."
1061,December 2015,dino001,"But how about reliability, longevity?  Can you say with certainty, it's unchanged?  Noise, wear, low end vs. high end torque.  I suppose it's possible that current factors of safety are so high that the lowering them does not bring appreciable differences.  I just caution against ""it's all free"" attitude.  In nature, nothing is free.  You always pay somewhere.  Engineering is an act of balancing competing interests, as people have different interests, it will result in different products, but everything comes with a price."
1062,December 2015,qbrozen,"Sure, it doesn't affect fuel economy...unless you actually use that extra power, at which point, why tune it at all? So, yes, it does increase fuel usage when you are utilizing those extra ponies. Nothing wrong with that."
1063,December 2015,kyfdx,"I think that the engineers that design the car could tell you, on a statistical basis, what the likelihood is."
1064,December 2015,dino001,"Well said.  There is no way of saying with certainty that an individual vehicle broke because of the mods.  However, the statistics and principles of physics say that the probability of such failure increased, it could be by a little or a lot, depending on how big the mod was, how the car was driven, etc."
1065,December 2015,roadburner,"I think it depends on the vehicle as well as the power increase that is sought. On my modified cars I have only pursued modest gains in horsepower/torque. Those gains might erode the reliability at the margin, but not to any significant extent. UOAs consistently indicate that the engines in my MS3 as well as my Club Sport are in excellent shape, so I'm not losing any sleep over the tweaks the cars have received."
1066,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I suspect the longevity of your cars relate much more to the high level of maintenance you give them then to the alleged benign nature of the modifications. Also I am sure you would agree that not all chips are engineered to a high standard, and that the consumer who is shopping price rather than reputation may end up with some rather bad results."
1067,December 2015,flightnurse,"I believe BMW and for that matter most sport car manufactures have engineered their engines to perform with added stress and still be reliable, I asked this before and you and others haven't comments.. BMW markets the MPK and MPE for their cars, if it would cause added stress and lower reliability why would they make them and warrens them? Maybe they know the engines can take it?  Nah that can't be it."
1068,December 2015,dino001,"You're missing my point entirely.  It's not if they can take it, it's which configuration is optimal for certain position in the market, considering all factors.  Apparently they believe factory configuration represents a better mix for the market.  You say they warrant those mods.  Just because it keeps the warranty, doesn't mean it's equally reliable.  Do you know what portion of that price is set aside for the warranty?  I don't. What I know are principles behind the engineering and they teach me nothing is free, everything is a tradeoff.  Small, or large."
1069,December 2015,flightnurse,"Dino I'm sorry you can't grasp the idea that the extra HP from the chips haven't reduced reliability, even Roadrunner has stated he has no problems with 154K miles on a car.  All my motorcycles engine have modifications and have been stone reliable."
1070,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I don't think he missed the point. I think he's making another point. Maybe we could look at it this way. If it was simple and cheap to give a Mazda 3 some 60 more HP, why wouldn't Mazda just do that? It would give them a tremendous edge on the competition and would make the car the darling of the auto magazines. The Mazda engineers must have been weighing something other than cost in this decision. After all, Mazda could build those mods you made for a fraction of what it cost you."
1071,December 2015,stickguy,"heck, the BMW tune is ""free"" to BMW since they have the computer in there anyway.  So it seems like a no brainer to give the car all the extra power for the same price."
1072,December 2015,qbrozen,"Because it is a limited warranty. It is a modest gain in power in those instances and they only need to cover it for 50k, 60k, or what have you. They may know, just for example, the unmodded engines can go 150k, while the modded ones go 120k. Either is certainly covered by warranty, but they'd rather have more of the 150k cars running around to uphold some face. If they made strictly vehicles that only lasted just past their warranty, it wouldn't bode well for their reputation."
1073,December 2015,dino001,
1074,December 2015,roadburner,"Both the Mazdaspeed Intake as well as the Hypertech Sport Tuner have CARB approval. As to why Mazda didn't sell the car that way from the get-go? In the case of the intake I'd say probably it's due to the fact it uses a washable filter, is a bit louder, and requires a bit more effort to access the filter. As for the tune, Mazda actually did offer a tune on the Australian 3 MPS Extreme, which boosted power by 18 hp  and torque by 33 lb-ft."
1075,December 2015,flightnurse,"So the numbers are in on the new BMW 340. BMS just Dynoed one, 331 to the wheels, it's quoted as making 320hp.. Now with the new Beta version of the BMS JB4 it makes 379hp at the wheel, that is with pump premium unleaded. a nice 48hp jump with a +3 lbs of boost.."
1076,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, but.....dynos are not absolute numbers, they can be conjurer's tricks. I'd like to see results from say three independent dynos.  I can make a dyno give you any number you pick.  There are a number of videos on YouTube in which dyno claims are tested---some prove true, some miss the mark."
1077,November 2015,stickguy,well.  could be something interesting to consider in 2 years when my Sonata goes back!
1078,November 2015,sweendogy,Flight nice color combo with the tints look sharp - how bout some shots of the boot
1079,November 2015,roadburner,"My dealer took in a 2012 135i M Sport(LeMans Blue/Alaska Gray) with most every option- including DCT- unfortunately. It is CPO, however and has only 12k miles on it. May yet look at it, but right now the '15 STI is still at the top of my list..."
1080,November 2015,Mr_Shiftright,Not the first automaker to make a claim against BMW 3-series crown.  We'll see....................
1081,November 2015,flightnurse,"More photo to follow. The 1 series just looked too odd to me, the 2 series I can live with"
1082,November 2015,sandman_6472,"And I prefer the 1 Series because I like a small vehicle. Saw one in blue that looked really nice but white really is the perfect color for this vehicle. Looks very sharp in white. Would truthfully like one of those after i trade the Golf down the road. Really is the perfect size for me and prefer a two door vehicle now. And by then, all the chicks will have flown the nest so affording one won't be an issue. Might as well enjoy ourselves in retirement and leave them all a little less!!"
1083,November 2015,roadburner,"The proportions of the 1er are a bit odd, but I find it to be an entertaining drive(DCT notwithstanding). The 2er is a nicely styled car, but so far I've been extremely underwhelmed behind the wheel."
1084,November 2015,flightnurse,"I ordered a BMS stage 1 for Ricks 328i and it arrived Friday, even though I have been under the weather, I spent a whole 20 minutes installing it. It made a big difference with my 320, it really has made a HUGE difference in Ricks 328i. According to BMS the stage 1 increases 40 HP, and 50lbs of torque I do not doubt that."
1085,November 2015,carnaught,"FN, does it affect one's warranty?"
1086,November 2015,nyccarguy,Yes
1087,November 2015,flightnurse,"It could if BMW would find the modification is the cause of the issue, however, the BMS makes less HP then the Dinan upgrade. I've had it on my car not for two years without problem, and so far I haven't read anyone having problems with it in their BMWs."
1088,November 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"There's probably an effect over time, since there is more stress on components from both increased HP and no doubt, more aggressive driving, but maybe that just means a new X part at 80K rather than 100K. Seems like a low risk item, and BMW owners have confidence in Berger. Naturally, they sell this tune only for offroad use only and won't ship to California of course.  It would be interesting to measure how much ""dirtier"" your engine becomes.  They're basically messing with boost, timing and mixture, so it must affect emissions in some respects."
1089,November 2015,flightnurse,Dinan get about 50 more HP and charge $1500... Steve Dinan stated that BMW engines are good to about 15% more HP without putting added stress on the engine. But their tune add's much more then 15%.
1090,November 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"That sounds about right, and he should know.  No ""tune"" is for free, something has to be given away."
1091,November 2015,kyfdx,
1092,November 2015,dino001,"You mean I can't put 200 hp blower, race it every weekend and expect the engine and transmission last for million miles?  What an outrage"
1093,November 2015,roadburner,Steve's license is always hanging by a thread; I think he has taken every traffic school offered in California. Satch knows a few good stories about him...
1094,November 2015,flightnurse,There is another Steve in Calif who builds cars for Ford and uses Fords engines in his cars that has a license issue.
1095,November 2015,flightnurse,Well I am entitled to do that AND have BMW pay for the repairs.
1096,November 2015,roadburner,My son and I met Steve Saleen at a car show several years ago; a really nice guy- he autographed several posters and brochures for my son.
1097,November 2015,nyccarguy,I distinctly remember having this discussion before.
1098,November 2015,flightnurse,"Brad you are missing the point, BMW knows that people will chip their cars and have a safety net built in regarding added HP. I do not think the BMS stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. I have 38K miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. OF course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. I would assume that BMW, Audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their cars to get the extra HP from them. If they don't, then they aren't being realistic."
1099,November 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"There comes a time in the quest for HP when, if you want a faster car, you should go out and buy a faster car."
1100,December 2015,nyccarguy,
1101,December 2015,flightnurse,"I made a mistake when I bought my 320i, I should have gotten a 328i. Listen learned... I almost pulled a trigger on a BMW Loaner, basically it was a fully loaded 328i, M Sport, Tech, DHP, Premium, Drivers Assistance package, heated seats. It only had 4K miles on it, MSRP was 52K, final sale price was $44K, but I would have had to roll about 9K into the deal, lease payments would have been about 576/m with zero out of pocket. decided not to do it. I'll tough it out until Oct 2017 when we a another ED. I like the M2, but I think it will  be small, I'm hoping that BMW will build a M4 Grand Coupe for 2018, if not then a 440i Grand Coupe it shall be, with the MPPK, and MPE, which makes more HP then the BMW stage 1."
1102,December 2015,flightnurse,"Yes, before I put the BMS on Rick's 328, I did back to back rides, and even though the GT is heavier it felt faster. Now that the GT has the BMS, it is much faster then my 320i."
1103,December 2015,sweendogy,Couple of things what is BMS? (My wife gets the other MS monthly)
1104,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Factory engineers have to compromise to give consumers a streetable package, decent MPG, good longevity, and a car that passes all emissions requirements. If they could just chip a car and give it a large HP boost over the competition, they would have done it. Obviously they didn't for some reasons related to the above parameters."
1105,December 2015,roadburner,"I think that a ""real enthusiast"" who isn't a horsepower junkie might buy a properly equipped 320i- but I'll concede that probably 99% of 320i buyers are ""lease to wear"" poseur/dweebs."
1106,December 2015,stickguy,count the pedals.  That will help weed them out.
1107,November 2015,robr2,Standalone stores were the plan. Then that nasty little worldwide recession hit and they had to scale back. Nobody was interested in spending the money to launch a new luxury brand.

1112,November 2015,graphicguy,"Around here, they forced the Lincoln dealers to become standalone several years ago.  Plus, they closed some, too.  So, maybe closing some of their stores allowed the stand alones to harvest more customers and be able to make it on their own."

1119,November 2015,stickguy,"interesting.  but probably not as great as it may seem.  First of all, hard to see it being cheaper overall, since you still have to pay for the oil, and the contraption."
1120,November 2015,markcincinnati,"Our experience with Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti over the past decade+ is that the oil change includes an inspection, report and other fluids top off; also included is a wash and vacuum. Tire pressure, too, is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal."

Sure, they free up room at the bottom of the engine, but that won't help with packaging under the hood!  Unless they put it on top of the engine, like the old Subaru's that had the spare tire there."

1125,November 2015,flightnurse,"It was simple, VW wanted to let buyers know that their cars are just as good as those other premium brands. Look at their product back then, the passt was really high end as far as fit and finish, and materials used, but it also was more expensive then the Camry's and Accords too. But we know that the upscale of VW failed and the bean counters got a hold of the cars, the new passt is nice, but no where as nice as the previous gen. The Golf feels upscale and some of the materials used is nicer then what one would get in Sentra or Corrola but those cars have more standard equipment then the Golf."
1126,November 2015,flightnurse,"Rick would get calls from the Hyundai deal to come and trade in his Genesis and the salesman would give him the big pitch about how Hyundai has made strides in quality and refinement.  On one of his secret shopping assignment we went to a Kia dealer to look at the new (then) Cadenza, we both liked the car, it was room, the list of standard equipment was extensive and the price (base) was right in the middle of the V6 Honda Accord line.Talking with the salesman we asked about the K900, he laughed and told  us that each Kia dealer was getting 1, and that is it. But of course some dealers didn't sell it and did a dealer trade to move it off the lot, the car was more of an exercise in, ""look what we can do, and showcase what Kia could be."" When it comes to Hyundai and the Genises and Equus I think you are going to see Hyundai move up scale with that brand. Both cars are bargains, they are reliable, and really a good bang for the buck, it has taken Hyundai years to be able to sell cars like those  here, and yes, Virginia they really do sell Equus. I'm thinking the accents cars are going away, and left for Kia to sell."

Being our first time going German, these are just my initial reactions to what I see and feel. Maybe next time I'll try a BMW just to see but hope they still make a small vehicle like the 1 Series by then."
1158,November 2015,sweendogy,"good banter here of late ... I am still an manual purist but I agree with Mark the transmission tied to the engine of the s4 is pretty perfect. It shifts so quick, is so veristile being a gentlemens salon to a sports sedan in a second and can get 30mpg on the highway- in fact as my s4 gets older (25k miles) it gets 20-22 in the city. Compared to my g35x it's night and day as I was getting city figures on the highway- and I loved that car. On the awd weight issue thing... With the optional limited slip diff you could never guess when pressing car into turns that its awd and weighs as much as a whale. I love the car. I can't wait to drive an s3 because for me it has everything I would need and would love to see how it compairs."
1159,November 2015,stickguy,"Sandy, in theory it is not the same engine.  mostly the same, but Audi may be tuned differently, which could explain the different feel, and premium.  But, more likely it is just that the Audi has more sound insulation or some such.  Check the specs on the 2 cars.  see if output is any different (peak HP/torque, at what RPM).  if they are the same, probably just psychological ploy, since premium buyers expect premium fuel!"

1163,November 2015,Michaell,"The problem is that Hyundai won't be putting the ""Genesis"" brand into their own stores. It will be more like Scion - a corner of an existing Hyundai store. Not sure if they are forcing the dealers to upgrade their facilities if they want to carry the 'brand', either."
1164,November 2015,markcincinnati,"One word should be at the top of ""the memo"" to [US] Genesis store owners:"
1165,November 2015,Michaell,Exactly.
1166,November 2015,rbirns1,"Still can't fathom the giant mistake by Hyundai in not taking a page from the Lexus/Infiniti/Acura playbook.  You cannot sell a true luxury car alongside mainstream cars.  If they want to be taken seriously by luxury buyers, they have to establish separate Genesis brand and dealers.  Should have done it from the start."
1167,October 2015,rbirns1,"It's all about branding.  You're right, they don't make economy class Rolexes.  Auto makers should not be diluting the quality of their brands by cheapening them.  Want a cheaper Audi?  Buy a Volkswagen."
1168,October 2015,andres3,"I'd love to get my '06 A3 back for a day and show you all just how many itty bitty little cost cuts Audi made to the current A3/S3 model generation.  I still think, however, that Audi is doing well because they do the least amount of ""cost cutting,"" of any brand."
1169,October 2015,tlong,"Not sure I buy that if there's no real luxury there. I drove a Mercedes A-class in Europe a few years ago. If they decided to bring that car here, would that automatically make it EELPS? Not in my book - no luxury (and not much performance) at all."
1170,October 2015,flightnurse,"Is it really??? Have you owned one?  I would put the Genesis sedan against the 5 series and E class, same size, just as quite is not quieter, ride is supple, standard equipment is greater then both of the Germans, just because it's built in Korea doesn't mean it's not a luxury car. In fact no one answer my question, when it comes to price, and which price we going to use to determine if the car is a luxury car.  You think car maker determines this."
1171,October 2015,roadburner,"Well, I may end up in another BMW yet. I posted this over in CCBA as well..."
1172,October 2015,stickguy,never say never.
1173,October 2015,markcincinnati,"I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example:  Tissot makes/markets watches.  These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches.  These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces."
1174,October 2015,rbirns1,"At the end of the day, that Genesis owner still has to tell his friends he drives a Hyundai."
1175,October 2015,henryn,"Yes, he does.  And his friends who know which end is up, will know that he is a very savvy car buyer.  Those who are status conscious, those who have to own a Rolex and drive a BMW just for the status, will look down their noses at him."
1176,October 2015,circlew,
1177,October 2015,thebean,"Rolex does make a cheaper watch - it's branded as a Tudor.  Instead of a Rolex movement, it has a movement made by ETA, which makes movements for a lot of watchmakers including Tag, Movado, and Tissot.  Rolex didn't want to ""sully"" the Rolex name but still wanted a piece of the medium price watch market."
1178,October 2015,flightnurse,"Interesting comment, having one in the family people are hard pressed to believe that Hyundai built the car. For people like yourself, the badge on the hood makes the car."
1179,October 2015,roadburner,Your ARE what you
1180,October 2015,breld,"My wife got her S3 this past August and absolutely loves it.  For her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the GTI she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature.  The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX.  No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us)."
1181,October 2015,sandman_6472,"Guess I prefer to drive what I like now...and can afford! Before I retired the first time, had to drive econoboxes due to finances and family situation...raising our kids. Now the situation is different and no longer need to drive those kind of vehicles and tried going the CUV route back in December of 2013 and bought a mid-line Hyundai Tucson. Very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. Wanted an A3 like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my VW Golf. Perfect size and fun to drive plus I feel like I've got a 3/4 A3 so all is good."
1182,October 2015,markcincinnati,"For most of us here, I assume, we really don't care what other folks think, within reason of course.  If you like the Audi, BMW or Mercedes BRAND, you like the brand, other's opinions are of tertiary importance."
1183,October 2015,tlong,"Funny, that's also what I see with TRD. I wouldn't pick that! (not that I want a pickup anyway)."
1184,October 2015,breld,"Even though I traded in my Mazda3 for the S4, I will whole-heartedly agree on your comments on the 3 being a ""cheap car that feels nice.""  Mine was the Grand Touring model with the appearance package, and at $26k, it was (and is) an excellent car.  Great driving dynamics, adequate power, and a better infotainment system than my Audi."
1185,October 2015,stickguy,"I came real close on the Mazda 3.  Just did not quite work out.  But I did think you could have rebadged it as an entry level Audi, with little or no changes, and people would have fawned all over it."
1186,October 2015,roadburner,"Agreed, the current Mazda 3 lifted the bar for its segment considerably- especially with respect to the interior."
1187,October 2015,andys120,"I've said it before and I'll say it again- in today's market the term ""luxury car"" is meaningless.  Back in the day if a car had power windows/ locks and air conditioning it was considered a luxury car but now almost every car has those things as well as many other entertainment and comfort features."
1188,October 2015,qbrozen,"well, I don't know about the term itself, but I feel there is definitely a big difference between a true luxury car and a mundane car loaded with options. No matter how many gadgets you throw on a Civic, it is still a Civic, and it won't compare to a 3-series in the end."
1189,October 2015,Michaell,"Not to throw gas on the fire - but, why?"
1190,October 2015,qbrozen,"I've tried to convince myself a ""lesser"" car is good enough. It just isn't. I did that when I leased an '06 Accord EXL V6. Figured ""hey, it has everything in it."" It only took a few months before the road noise, quality of materials, seat comfort, etc, got on my nerves."
1191,October 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I don't think ""luxury"" is about gadgets but about the quality of materials....and yes...the badge on the grille does matter, as does the MSRP to some extent.  I know this doesn't speak too well of human perceptions vs. reality, but remember that experiment where the people dressed in white lab coats seemed more ""believable"" to participants than the people dressed in ordinary street clothes, even though both were saying the same thing?"
1192,October 2015,stickguy,"Well, if mainstream brands can't go ""up"", can Luxo brands go down?   Thinking of the MB CLA and upcoming BMW (1 series?). The FWD models trying to cover the bottom end.  Did the descend into Acura territory?  Has the civic touring elevated to that?"
1193,October 2015,qbrozen,"We are in agreement. The badge does add some cost, but there is some justification behind it, such as materials, build tolerances, engineering."
1194,October 2015,andres3,"What kind of HP does the Mazda 3 offer in top trim (no Speed 3 is available last I checked?  Although described as adequate, I have a feeling even the 1.8T from VW/Audi would leave it in the dust?"
1195,October 2015,andres3,"What kind of HP does the Mazda 3 offer in top trim (no Speed 3 is available last I checked?  Although described as adequate, I have a feeling even the 1.8T from VW/Audi would leave it in the dust?"
1196,October 2015,andres3,"Honda is good on safety, but if I was forced to have a head on collision between the 320i and the Civic, I'd choose the 320i for my bones and body.  How about you?  Be honest."
1197,October 2015,carnaught,"Mark, I like your A7 review..thanks.  My problem with it is that it is verrry low to the ground making egress especially interesting for some."
1198,October 2015,henryn,"Well ... yes and no.  I just purchased a new ""Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer)"".  I opted for the new for this year twin-turbo 2.7L engine, which is entirely unproven.  (As to longevity, I mean.)  If I had planned to keep the truck ""until the wheels turn square"", most likely would have opted for the old school V8 engine.  With this particular engine (the twin turbo), if I were to decide to keep it past end of warranty, I will most likely spring for the extended factory warranty BEFORE the base warranty expires."
1199,October 2015,andres3,"I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early).  I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change.  Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is.  If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound.  Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp."
1200,October 2015,flightnurse,So why not follow manufacture recommended service? What do you know that others don't?
1201,October 2015,flightnurse,"Mark in regards to the A7, I think it's one of Audi's better designed cars, I would love to have one myself. But not too sure what packages I would want on it, sport package would high on the list."
1202,October 2015,roadburner,"It's a bit like apples and oranges, but I have over 20 UOAs on my MS3 and they indicate that M1 5W-30 is good for at least 10k miles in that application, and note that DI turbos are supposed to be particularly hard on oil. And M1 0W-40 is fine for 10k miles in the M54 in my son's X3."
1203,October 2015,markcincinnati,"Both my wife and I have the Audi Advantage Pre-paid program; however, we have an oil and filter (and check up overall) performed EVERY 5,000 miles, meaning we pay for every other interval and the odd intervals are paid for as part of the Audi Advantage."
1204,October 2015,roadburner,"Have you had a UOA performed at 5,000 miles? If not, how do you know that changing the oil at that mileage provides ""insurance""?"
1205,October 2015,cdnpinhead,OMG -- Fact-based analysis.  What's the world coming to?
1206,October 2015,andres3,I know what not one but two highly trusted mechanic's/shop manager's said.
1207,October 2015,stickguy,didn't the BMW service intervals jump right when they started paying for the service?  I'm sure it was pure coincidence!
1208,October 2015,andres3,"I guess you can't know for sure, but what line in the sand results from a UOA would you use?  Some people might draw their line in the sand more stringently, and of course, driving conditions and habits can change any individual's results, even with the same car and oil."
1209,October 2015,flightnurse,"BMW uses synthetic oil, and the study's shows that synthetic oil last longer so why change the oil when not necessary."
1210,October 2015,stickguy,"Well, still hard to imagine that 14-15K is good, but could be."
1211,October 2015,dino001,"They have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year.  They lowered the mileage cap to 12k, I think.  Condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity.  The only thing it doesn't take into account is environment.  They don't have oil sensors (I don't think anybody does), so if it gets dusty or contaminated, you wouldn't know it."
1212,October 2015,flightnurse,Dino I think the computer can take into account max temp.. My service intervals are less during summer months
1213,October 2015,markcincinnati,"Here's my statement:  I change the oil, at the dealer, every 5,000 miles.  For all I know it is a waste of money, not any real ""insurance"" whatsoever. The 10K intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities.  My wife's Infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil.  We changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil."
1214,October 2015,roadburner,"If the TBN is over 1.5 and wear metals(aluminum, copper, iron, lead) are tracking within about 25% of universal averages(adjusted for mileage) I would think that your oil is probably being changed too early. Aside from the break in period and the variable valve timing actuator TSB the UOAs from my MS3 have been remarkably consistent- even when the car has seen the track."
1215,October 2015,andres3,"Any issues with needed sludge and carbon deposits/build-up cleaned?  Injector, induction, and other cleanings?  I know my A3 seemed much more lively after one of these services, but it was no Jiffy Lube job, it was a serious induction system cleaning."
1216,October 2015,roadburner,"I run a bottle of Techron through the MS3 every 3k miles; no other ""cleanings."" In-gear acceleration times have remained consistent since 40k miles so I don't see a need for any other treatments."
1217,October 2015,markcincinnati,"roadburner - We have become true believers in using only Top-Tier gasolines -- and now that Costco participates in that designation (and we have two Costco fuel locations fairly close to home), even the prices for TTG aren't shocking anymore."
1218,October 2015,roadburner,Yes; I've use Top Tier fuel in everything save the Jeep for years.
1219,October 2015,markcincinnati,
1220,October 2015,markcincinnati,
1221,October 2015,tlong,"When I sat in the A3 sedan, it felt kind of like a ""nice car that was cheap"" if that makes any sense. (referring to quality as opposed to price). My 1998 A4 was about the same size as the current A3 sedan but the older A4 was a much nicer car inside."
1222,October 2015,carnaught,
1223,October 2015,rbirns1,It should be simple.  Entry level luxury is the lowest priced models of  luxury makes.
1224,October 2015,flightnurse,Priced as MSRP or payments?  Just saw an ad here in Phoenix for a 2015 Hyundai Geneses sedan for $299/m or BMW 320i for $259/m
1225,October 2015,rbirns1,"Genesis, nice as it may be, is really stretching the definition since Hyundai is not a luxury make.  3-series is clearly entry-level luxury."
1226,October 2015,markcincinnati,"Point taken, but my sense is that the S3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the VW side of the house.  Even a sub-$50K S4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, Premium."
1227,October 2015,tlong,"Sometimes the problem is that image is just tarnished. They're making pretty good cars, but the name says Old People Boats. Hard to shake that. And of course the franchise agreements the dealers have with GM pretty much constrain much flexiblity for GM. I would have said close down Caddy and start a differently-named luxury division, but probably not practical."
1228,October 2015,graphicguy,""""
1229,October 2015,circlew,Still would rather the Q50 over the ATS/CTS. But that's probable just me!
1230,October 2015,nyccarguy,I like the Q50 & I've even warmed up to the TLX in its V6 SH-AWD trim.  Both cars offer tremendous bang for the buck which is very important in this category.
1231,October 2015,stickguy,"I love the TLX, but in FWD 4 cyl form.  great transmission."
1232,October 2015,andres3,"The $10-15K extra for the Golf R is worth it as compared to the GTI.  As someone who threw thousands into a former A3, I should know.  You get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning.  Most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your Golf R safely to 350 HP +/- for very little money.  Whereas running 300 or more HP on a regular GTI by matching the turbo in the Golf R works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability.  Also, the R is 3rd generation Haldex AWD."
1233,October 2015,sweendogy,
1234,October 2015,andres3,"I guess it all comes down to if you find the current generation GOLF an econobox or not.  I found it to be quite well detailed and trimmed inside and out.  The chassis is strong, tight, and light.  All good things.  I haven't test driven the Golf R yet; that's the next step.  I'd bet money the rare flaws I found in the Mexican built Golfs/Sportwagens is non-existent in the German built R.  Another big-time PLUS for the R in my book vs. other Golf's.  That alone makes it not just ""another"" Golf to me."
1235,October 2015,markcincinnati,Here's another issue that Cadillac faces:  The Auto Mall (AM).
1236,October 2015,qbrozen,"I'm obviously in the ""undervalued"" camp. Although I did get a significant discount on my CTS, which pushed the decision very far in Caddy's favor, I did compare to BMW and Jag (never made it to the Benz dealer) and, since I value performance, preferred the Caddy. Even if it was the same cost, I would have thought the CTS the better car, although it is possible the steeper depreciation would have swayed me if not for the discount."
1237,October 2015,dino001,"Never been a big fan of Caddy's styling, but I always looked at a previous CTS Wagon as a ""far out there, maybe one day"" alternative.  Graphic's problems ultimately crossed out it as a possibility and lack of a proper sports wagon, or other type of lift/hatchback (5-door of any kind that is not raised) does not help, either.  I'm kind of stuck with 3- or 4- series, even if I wanted something else.  E-class wagon is too big and too expensive for me at this time.  Don'd care much for cladding on the Allroad.  I may check out V60, but seems like it has pretty bad mileage in its proper ""R"" form (not to mention dealers don't have them - I may look at S60-R as a proxy).  All others dropped out."
1238,October 2015,tlong,"I think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of Caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, I haven't checked). Since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make Caddy MORE expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? Or is GM basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?"
1239,October 2015,qbrozen,"Make no mistake, the other luxo models depreciate steeply, too. I've lost about $13k-$14k on my CTS in the first year of ownership (only that low thanks to discount). A comparable 550i is down roughly $20k (assuming I could have gotten about $5k off, which I'm totally guessing at). They have to heavily subsidize their leases, too."
1240,October 2015,Michaell,"I don't have any Cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say."
1241,October 2015,henryn,"Which puts you at about $1100 or $1200 a month, just in depreciation.  Ouch!!!"
1242,October 2015,andres3,"Was that Mustang GT brand new?  Hard to believe there wasn't depreciation on a ""new"" car."
1243,October 2015,qbrozen,Mustang was new. It was about $4k over 18 mos.
1244,October 2015,flightnurse,Well GC got a hell of a discount on his CTS too. Best deal doesn't always mean best car.
1245,October 2015,flightnurse,"BNW has issues with the 550, but the other models are holding better, but we all know that BMW over inflates their residual on the leases.  But if you take a M3 and ATS V-Sport I'm sure the BMW will have a higher sale value, the same could  be said with the M5 and CTS V Sport."
1246,October 2015,qbrozen,"Like I said, I got what I thought was the best car for me... I just happened to get the best deal on it, too."
1247,October 2015,henryn,"If you want to play with the big boys, you better bring your check book!  (smile)"
1248,October 2015,markcincinnati,"Most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented.  The thing is, part of the formula is based on MSRP -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the MSRP still makes certain calculations limited in outcome."
1249,October 2015,tlong,"I suspect that's true in many cases - business deductions, or if you buy every 3 years or maybe even every 5."
1250,October 2015,roadburner,"I don't suffer from Shiny Object Syndrome, I buy cars I really like and hold on to them. 20 years in the case of the Club Sport, 13 years in the case of the Wrangler, and 8 years in the case of the MS3. That said, I've still owned 20 cars over my 42 years of driving. For my current 5 car fleet I budget $425 per month for maintenance and repairs- I guess that's really stupid- I should probably just lease 3 cars and make payments of upwards of $2100 month; that way I'd certainly save money."
1251,October 2015,cdnpinhead,"Hmmm.  In my 47 years of driving cars (only motorcycles until I was 20) I've had 7 that accumulated ~850K miles, with my 240Z's 224K miles the highest.  So, there are three of us that do this sort of thing on here anyway.  I'm not counting the 200K I put on my '71 KW, but those two years I was driving my car a lot less."
1252,October 2015,sandman_6472,"My '15 Golf SE doe not have power start and after having it in a loaner, would really have liked to have it. Not sure what 2016 will show, but doubt they'll add it. Thinking one day all vehicles will have power start and keys will no longer be necessary."
1253,October 2015,flightnurse,"When you say ""power start"" do you mean ""Remote Start"" since all cars have power start..  BMW does not offer remote start on the 3,4 or 5 series cars, which is ashame living here in the desert, it is nice to be able to start your car before getting into to cool it off.."
1254,October 2015,carnaught,Maybe Sandy means keyless start.
1255,October 2015,sandman_6472,"Yes, no button on the console like the Jetta I drove had...just pushed the button and the car started up. At first I didn't like it but after a couple of days, I loved it! Would be so much easier to not have to deal with a key at all!"
1256,October 2015,markcincinnati,
1257,October 2015,qbrozen,"$37k? ouch! It is still a Focus, after all."
1258,October 2015,roadburner,"I'd pay $37k, but not what the dealers will ask. 345 hp, torque vectoring, Drift Mode- certainly some of the most fun you can have under $5k- never mind $37k. I'd consider one if I didn't want a truly fast RWD track toy."
1259,October 2015,qbrozen,"I don't think I could do it. Once a car breaks that $30k barrier, I can no longer justify an econobox, no matter how capable. A Charger RT is cheaper, and a Scat Pack is only marginally more."
1260,October 2015,robr2,Golf R is $38K but it's still a Golf.
1261,October 2015,qbrozen,I class them as subcompact econoboxes and compact econoboxes.
1262,October 2015,roadburner,Whatever I get it will be something that I can actually say is fast with a straight face- a 0-100 in around ten seconds or less qualifies. My new sled also has to have fairly decent track capability- if it can lap VIR in 3:05 seconds or so it merits consideration.
1263,October 2015,flightnurse,"For the price nothing will be as fast, one of the  better bang for the bucks cars out there."
1264,October 2015,qbrozen,"I'll be curious to see how it does vs the Mustang. The weight advantage and AWD would indicate it should be better in the twisties. Ford's 0-60 estimate is 4.7 secs, mustang is 4.5, and scat pack is 4.4. Top speed of the Focus and Stang are both 164 vs the Scat Pack's 176. Honestly, the Focus is going to have to dominate on the track, IMHO, to overcome its small cheap car roots for that pricetag."
1265,October 2015,flightnurse,"Hey Graphic one of your computers has a virus, just got a spam e-mail from you on your Yahoo account..."

I have a rare name and don't get as many spam email, as say Joe Smith would get.  For several years I was getting almost nothing, but the spammers finally cracked the code of my email address.

I suppose by year 2000 standards it might qualify as somewhat ""luxury"" but I doubt it would meet today's competition in that area."

I commuted with it for three years - a bit noisy, but generally easy to drive, steer, not too harsh (for me) on the back.  As long as you understood what you had, it was fine.  I traded for my current 328i, because that's what I wanted - a finer, nicer automobile, with some more ""stuff"", even if (quite a bit) slower."

1288,October 2015,markcincinnati,BMW reduces ED discount from 7% to 5%.
1289,October 2015,robr2,The ED MSRP and Invoice is 7% and will be 5% less than the normal MSRP and Invoice price.  It is possible to negotiate a better ED price on a BMW than the official prices as there is some profit left for the dealer.
1290,October 2015,dino001,Small additions/corrections:
1291,October 2015,andres3,"If flying to DC in gross polluting high NOX emission jet planes begging for bailouts for failed business enterprises didn't hurt the Big 3's reputation much, certainly tricking the EPA won't hurt much either other than fines that go into somebodies pocket."

1293,October 2015,flightnurse,"Mark, the MSRP for a ED BMW is still lower then the ""regular"" MSRP, since the car is considered a used car to the US government and so the tax's are lower."
1294,October 2015,dino001,"Which taxes?  Surely not my sales tax.  Florida taxes new and used car sales the same, anyway, I think.  Perhaps you are thinking of US custom tariff, which if true, would make sense.  I have no idea what tariffs are on vehicles, as they are generally included in the price of the product and not itemized the same way say state sales taxes are."
1295,October 2015,robr2,"My understanding isn't that the import taxes are that much less on a used car,  Rather, ED cars do not have holdback on them, don't qualify for dealer incentives or bonus money, and the US subsidiary profit is wiped away since they didn't sell the car.  Hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."
1296,October 2015,markcincinnati,"Someone said the dealer would rather sell off the lot than promote/sell a car not yet built.  From the time I had purchased my 5th or 6th Audi -- and became friends with my dealer/owner -- he told me he would much rather have only ""test drive"" inventory, service loaner inventory and some used cars.  He shared with me that ordered cars have some profit, whereas cars on the lot have less profit.  He said he wished US customers were more like European customers, in that they order cars -- dealers are not for the purpose of inventory control, rather they are in the business of demand creation and demand fulfillment via taking orders."
1297,October 2015,dino001,"I agree that your friend store owner would rather his business model changed, if he could, and sell cars from a book.  However, the reality of US customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories.  So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity.  The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock."
1298,October 2015,stickguy,"Many people still buy cars because they have to get one right away.  Accident, old one died, etc.  so has to be some amount of inventory."

I ONCE got a black interior (and that was in an Acura TL) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that I would walk out rather than have a black interior car.  I got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- I get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty."
1301,October 2015,flightnurse,"Because that is what sells. Now this according to a couple of Client advisers I have spoken with. For BMW black interior is the color of choice, I don't get it, since it makes the interior of a 3 series look small."
1302,October 2015,dino001,"I have black interior and I like it.  Saddle brown is pretty good, too.  But I've seen a lot of white and beige around here. Now - the higher level models, like 7-series probably do have more black interiors than anything."
1303,October 2015,stickguy,"After having black leather in my Accord, I said never again.  too hot, and dreary."
1304,October 2015,tlong,"Agree, I don't like black. Only car we've ever had with black interior is our Mazda 5 and the black carpet shows every bit of dust and particles."
1305,October 2015,kyfdx,I like black.
1306,October 2015,carnaught,"I've always liked a white car with a coral red, chestnut, or saddle leather interior.  I agree, it has to have the dark carpeting.  White or silver cars with black interiors, to me, are lack-luster."
1307,October 2015,roadburner,"Same here, my wife's 2009 E90 has a full beige interior and the carpets and seats show the tiniest speck of dirt. It doesn't help that the more recent BMW interiors don't age all that well; the interiors of my 2007 MS3(156k miles) and 1995 E36(142k miles) show much less wear."
1308,October 2015,flightnurse,"When I do my ED in 2017, my 440i Grand Coupe will be Mineral Grey with Coral Interior."
1309,October 2015,dino001,"I will have Melbourne Red 440i GC with either black/red stitch or saddle brown.  Don't know yet. Very strange, but BMW just restricted the red from M-Sports package just on the 4-series (you can have it with 3).  I don't really get it.  I like that package for the shadowline trim (black door frames), but I'd likely let it go, as I still rather have the red."

1311,October 2015,flightnurse,"Hey Dino what is the draw of the M Sport?   Currently I'm just looking at a 440i, Track Package, Driver Assistance package, Tech package.  The Track Package has the M Adaptive Suspension and for $1700 it's a steal."
1312,October 2015,dino001,"I basically like the black exterior treatment aesthetics of tha package vs. standard chrome treatments.  That's what I have now., by the way, but back then it was packaged differently.  I liked the old Le Mans Blue, no longer available.  Estoril grew on me a little, but I didn't like it at first.  Now it is my second choice, Imperial Blue close third.  Very close, more like depends on the time of the day."
1313,October 2015,flightnurse,I wish we could have gotten Mediterranean blue.
1314,October 2015,dino001,"It's the new one, only on sedan and wagon so far.  It is nice, indeed."
1315,October 2015,sandman_6472,"The black interior of our white gloss A3 just seems to fit the size of the vehicle. On my blue Golf, got the ivory interior and so glad I did because in the hot South Florida, black is just too hot for me. When I had a loaner Jetta with the black inside, I just knew I made the right decision. The wife has not complained about her A3's black guts and I don't ask. In the A3, don't think the ivory inside would look very nice, black just seems to work. The Audi has been flawless though the Golf has had a few teething issues but now, all has quieted down as I rack up the miles."

1320,September 2015,dino001,"Agree.  Look at the other compliant (as far as we know, anyway) diesels - mileage margins against their gas counterparts is diminishing, the durability is basically gone, the robustness is gone (they are very sensitive to fuel quality).  I'm more and more convinced European diesel explosion was a huge con perpetuated by the officials and manufacturers on the people to lower CO2 with all other more harmful stuff ignored.  Euro VI standards are just catching up with EPA and they will wake up to the new reality that diesel doesn't look so great anymore."

Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing."

1363,September 2015,markcincinnati,What kind of additional costs are we talking about for ad-blue annually? (at the 2.0L engine size).
1364,September 2015,benjaminh,"My guess is that it wasn't ultimately the cost but the performance that was the real issue. It seems like it was probably c. $300 or less per car to meet the rules, but at the same time power would have been down by a bit, mpg would have been down a bit, and heavy adblue use would have raised the cost for the customer, weakening the case for trading in a gas car for a diesel given the premium of thousands of dollars over gas in msrp."
1365,September 2015,stickguy,"I'm still confused at to why the fix costs anything. Just flash the code to stay in test taking trim, and there you go.  Mpg and performance, well that will be whatever it is."

Seems that all, or most, car companies have had their share of problems over the years, some worse than others, but most have survived and thrived in later years. We're not worried one bit, as we keep our vehicles longer than the average owner does, and look forward to many years of fun driving ahead. If had to do it all again, the only change I think I'd make is I'd have also bought an A3, in a different color though. Since the wife had a bigger budget than I, the Golf seemed to be the next best alternative to a similar vehicle since one seems to be built upon the other."
1369,September 2015,ctl,"I won't be so optimistic. Even though the damage it causes (more air pollution) doesn't seem so serious, the cost and fine for recalling 11M cars doesn't seem out of hand for a company this size, the lost trust might be repaired overtime... the law suits from owners and governments around the world can really bring VW to its knees. It's one thing to build a lousy car or falsify the HP or MPG, another to intentionally cheat. One of the above can be criminally charged."
1370,September 2015,tlong,"Honestly I'd like to see companies that are blatant cheaters to go down HARD. Unfortunately it doesn't usually happen. The big US banks are all bigger than ever and ready to cause a new economic destruction. I'm sure VW won't be hit all that hard. I used to like VW, had VWs for many years, but the combination of parts costs, crappy dealer service, decontented blandmobiles, and now severe cheating is enough for me to never touch them again."

1372,September 2015,markcincinnati,"Well, then, if you are correct and it seems logical that you are -- I still don't understand why VW would risk so much for a couple hundred or so bucks increase in the MSRP. Also, the total US number of cars affected is just south of 500K, globally it is 11M.  If VW just thought the US EPA was BS, why cheat on the other 10.5M cars?"

1399,September 2015,markcincinnati,70% of autos sold in Europe are oil burners.  I would expect that 50% of these are the small block engines.  The small block engines are the ones claiming they need not be ad-blue to achieve improved emissions.
1400,September 2015,benjaminh,
1401,September 2015,kyfdx,"The engineers should have got word to the marketers, huh?"
1402,September 2015,dino001,"The answer is YES.  18 billion is just a potential.  I expect that settle at 2-5 billion plus a few scapegoats of middle to high level.  The real one is if there is any issue with European market, half of their staff is going to prison.  BTW, 10-40 times would probably not pass 20 year standards, so the deceipt is beyond staggering.  This is not Hyundai adding couple of mpg, or Toyota overstating the engine power by 5 hp.  This is a systematic and brazen sabotage of the system."
1403,September 2015,robr2,"Maybe, maybe not.  Keep in mind that the emissions requirements in Europe are not as strict as the CARB/EPA requirements so under the current tuning, the 2.0 may meet their standards.  My understanding is that a new emissions requirement just went into affect in Europe on 9/1 that brings diesel requirements much closer to the CARB levels.  It's possible that the VW won't pass this new standard."
1404,September 2015,dino001,"What also bothers me here is that those VW's are small in numbers, but we all know how ""clean"" are trucks, buses and pickups.  VW cheating is a big deal on the priniple, but I would not go as far as calling them some kind of superpollutants.  They may be ecxeeding limits 40 times, but one can ask what kind of limits are on those stinky and noisy schoolbuses and semis, if their spewing big black clouds is within those limits."
1405,September 2015,tlong,"Knowing how the financial institutions' thievery involving the financial crisis in 07/08 was addressed in the US (moderate fines at best, not even one exec imprisoned for the downfall of the entire economy), I suspect that the US government will slap their wrists and have a moderate punishment. Hopefully the EU regulators have a lot more teeth than the US does."

1410,September 2015,markcincinnati,"The new S4 has been announced and the details are impressive -- of course the question for the US market, as usual, are led by:  When will this (or some very similar version) be coming to our shores?  The timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes Audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year.  Of course, I just read there will be an RS3 coming, with 350 HP, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 HP S4 and shop it against the RS3."
1411,September 2015,rayainsw,flightnurse -
1412,September 2015,flightnurse,"Mark we saw one RS3 in Europe it was a 3 door hatchback, just cursing on the highway with us slow pokes, Since the #40i has gained HP the S4 should too."

1414,September 2015,graphicguy,Mark...don't know if you saw the details...
1415,September 2015,andres3,"I heard the bad news that not only did someone at Audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming S4 with a slushy 8 speed ZF auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option."
1416,September 2015,nyccarguy,Don't wait.  Order another one to your specs.  Trade in and get one of the last of the current generation while you can.  Reset the warranty clock & get one that hasn't been clobbered by a Lexus RX.
1417,September 2015,flightnurse,Car manufactures will never make everybody happy. I would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the DSG in normal traffic Enthusiasts will always lose out.
1418,September 2015,flightnurse,"First it was a Subaru not a lexus, second with the devalue of his S4 his trade in value is less. The accident I'm sure is on his car fax."
1419,September 2015,markcincinnati,"With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?"
1420,September 2015,andres3,"I'd agree that Audi's implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4.  In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3.  To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such.  I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like.  People didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense.  I don't mind feeling the shift under power."
1421,September 2015,andres3,"Nope,"
1422,September 2015,breld,"As someone who just recently purchased an S4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the DSG, I'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the DSG being so darned good.  As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked.  Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding."
1423,September 2015,breld,
1424,September 2015,nyccarguy,
1425,September 2015,andres3,"Congrats on joining the S4 owner ranks around here.  In my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, I""d rather the choice be between a manual or DSG rather than an 8-speed Auto/Tip vs. CVT (for example)."
1426,September 2015,graphicguy,"Here 'ya go, Gents....."
1427,September 2015,breld,Now that's funny.
1428,September 2015,breld,"If I recall correctly from the articles on the A4, that actually will come with the DSG as the sole transmission.  With the upgraded 2.0T and the apparently improved driving dynamics, that should be very competitive in the segment."
1429,September 2015,markcincinnati,breld:
1430,September 2015,breld,"Just did a bit more research - it appears that the DSG (7-speed) will be offered on the FWD models on the upcoming A4, with the AWD models continuing with the 8-speed.  That's according to a Consumer Reports article.  I can't say that I've driven a FWD A4 - for some reason you can't find them here in Colorado - but I have to imagine that DSG is a nice upgrade over the CVT."

1435,September 2015,markcincinnati,"I took a look, not a drive, a look, at the latest and greatest Mazda Miata which lists for a number beginning with a 2.  Not sure I'd want a two seater (then again, if the kid and 3 or 4 of his friends can't get in all at once, maybe that would be less, er, distracting).  But, the point is, this car seems to be ONE of the exceptions to the ""no alluring cars"" comments I made above.  Also, there are a couple of VW's that seem to have some sizzle to them."

1440,September 2015,robr2,"And that is why the French don't like Americans.  Most don't even bother to try to speak in French instead expecting everyone else to speak English.  Well guess what - they do but they appreciate your faulting attempt to speak their language.  Once you start to ""embarrass"" yourself they will speak with you in English.  It's called courtesy.  How would you feel if a tourist came up to you in Cincinnati and started speaking in French without even an attempt to speak English?  I'm guessing the same as that waiter."
1441,September 2015,dino001,"These sensitivities can run very deep and show up in surprising places.  For example, in Belgium there are Flemish (Dutch) speekers and French Wallons.  Brussels is a French speaking enclave in the middle of Flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by French speakers, both government and European Union officials.  You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that.  It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French.  They do, but they want to be asked."
1442,September 2015,cdnpinhead,Spoken like someone who knows what they do at Ft. Knox (besides store gold).  I've been involved with the engine since about '94.
1443,September 2015,jeffm5,"I've never been to Europe, but my wife visited Italy about 3 yrs. ago.  Her interactions with the locals were very positive.  She'd love to go back.  As for the ""surly French"" - I've heard that same comment from many Americans of varied backgrounds who've visited France.  My opinion is if it wasn't for Americans like my late father who participated in D-Day they would be speaking German now.  And my late Aunt told that to a surly sales person she had an unpleasant interaction with in Paris.  God Bless America!!"
1444,September 2015,dino001,"Here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world.  Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals).  All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn't put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients).  Reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him.  BTW, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc.  You get the picture."
1445,September 2015,jeffm5,"I don't mean to sound like an ""Ugly American"".  It's just that you hear so many comments from Americans of all stripes about rude and boorish behavior from the French.  Shame on any American who treats a French visitor rudely because they can't or won't speak English.  Also shame on any American visiting France who feels they are entitled to special treatment because of what happened during WW II.  I'm just asking for common courtesy."
1446,September 2015,dino001,"Agreed.  There is no excuse for lack of courtesy, regardless if where you are.  Then working in a service industry, it should be you way of life."
1447,September 2015,roadburner,I agree 100%. I just can't stand the French attitude; in contrast I love the Italians and they seem to love us- and we DEFEATED them...
1448,September 2015,markcincinnati,"I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc.  I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University.  As a visitor in many European and Central European (I've not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America's participation and help in past wars.  I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives.  My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English."
1449,September 2015,flightnurse,"France is the only country that acts like this, I speak Spanish, and I sign in American Sign Language, but sorry I don't speak french... If you don't like it, that is your issue not mine. So far the rudest drivers have been the french, if there is a cm of space they will take it, no signal they will just come over. Had a run in with a motorcyclist today, he wanted to cut in, front of me, and got all bent out of shape because I wouldn't back up to allow him to pass... He stood in front of our car and [non-permissible content removed] at us, that was until I got out of the car, he hoped back on his bike and took off, the karma of it was he rear ended a car about 5 cars in front of us, a55hole..."
1450,September 2015,flightnurse,"Mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ED, Now for 2016 BMW has made major changes to the 3 series, but the GT and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. ALL 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, NOW, for some odd reason, BMWNA does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the M sport package or Sport.. So the trick to is order the Dynamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the M Adaptive Suspension (think GM's magnetic ride.) So with those two options the DHP is only 1K and the M Adaptive Suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of RWD cars.  So with that, we also got the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Tech package (we love the heads up display) Drivers assistance package, Auto High beams, Alarms is standard for 2016. So we have 2500KM on the car, I love the ACC, but I wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in France if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front..."

1460,September 2015,flightnurse,"So as I mentioned Beaune, France is in the heart of the Burgundy region of France. So the first day we just walked about Beaune, it's much bigger then what Rick and I assumed it was. Now, most towns in Europe are old, and Beaune is no different, we are talking settled right around 1440, so the charm of the city is the age, and how clean the city is. Besides being in the heart of the Burgundy region Beaune also is known for Hospices de Beaune which was founded in 1442, it's an amazing place, hospice holds a special place in my heart. So sit back and enjoy the photos of the city."

Spoke to the concierges, told him what we were looking for, he nodded, and said he knew what to do... Oh lord, this will cost me..  Fast forward to Sunday morning, the same concierges informed us that he has us booked, cost 500 euro for the both of, and it's a PVT tour.. I knew it was going to cost me.."

1483,September 2015,flightnurse,"BMW has what they call Individual colors for both exterior and Interior leather colors, as well as Options, when you choose an Individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. Now, the 3 GT is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. So for our GT to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. BMWNA does not allow for Individual options on the 3 series in the US, but they are available for BMWAG customers."

If they move to the left and are impeding traffic due to their concentration being on their cell phone, I will slowly pass on the right, beep my horn and give the international ""hang up the phone"" sign so they get they are moving too slowly."
1515,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Well, that's one.  I guess I'm talking about a ""national and cultural"" mindset that almost literally develops hives or some other nasty rash when contemplating the notion of passing on the right and ignoring a polite three wink left turn-signal."

1520,August 2015,qbrozen,"yeah, I don't get the idea of making it illegal to pass on the right. I would hope, however, if a state has both no pass on right AND stay right pass left laws, a cop is going to pull the left-lane camper over instead of the right-lane passer."
1521,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Traffic flow = the ""Natural Speed Limit.""  Several studies show that if the speed limit on a given highway is 65 and the flow is 80 - 85, that the flow remains virtually unchanged, when the speed limit is raised to 75 or 80 even.  The flow of traffic like the ebb and flow (rise and fall) of the stock market really does have a mind of its own.  Efforts to enforce (and seriously fine) lane protocols would do far more to increase the safety of many of our highways than ""speed traps"" will ever do."

1524,August 2015,andres3,"The fact traffic enforcement concentrates on speeding tickets (which lead to virtually no danger or accidents), and routinely completely ignores left lane passing laws is one of the biggest crimes of the past century.

I know my dad was more of a GM man than Ford man and he had a disdain for Chrysler yet his first car was a Plymouth and he told me it served him well.  Dad wasn't that keen on Chevys, but he was ok with Pontiac, Olds, or Cadillac.  For some reason Buick didn't have any appeal to him.  Though there has been  the odd Toyota, Datsun, Subaru that have been bought as secondary cars and cars for my sisters to drive for college (early 80's), my parents until retiring their 98 Aurora, have stayed the course with GM products.  They currently have a CR-V."
1529,August 2015,qbrozen,"I think its simply a matter of age. You gotta reach far back to find most of the Cadillac fans, like my dad and father-in-law, and they aren't buying cars in that pricerange in their golden years. Those same people would NEVER consider a BMW. The BMW faithful, on the other hand, largely have a car history that dates back to the E30-E36 era, and those cars cemented their fandom. Cadillac is now chasing a younger crowd who never previously gave them a 2nd look, while BMW is slowly alienating its fans with softer cars. How will that all pan out? We'll see."
1530,August 2015,stickguy,"effectively BMW is aging with their fanbase. Caddy had a head start, and once they ""age out"" you are kind of stuck.  At least BMW is still bringing in younger buyers at the bottom end, even if they are a different type than they used to have!"
1531,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Apparently they are not interested in ""driving dynamics"" as much as they used to be -- on the  other hand, we'd be hard pressed these days to find virtually any up and coming ""customer"" to even consider a manual transmission; sport suspensions, too, seem to be largely in the rearview mirror -- I remember when MOST of the cars in stock had sport suspensions, sport seats and at the same time a good many of the cars in stock were manual shift models, replete with Premium pack, power assists, and other options of the day."

During that time I was starting a career and family and money was tight.  All I could afford was Chevys and I was satisfied, until my '79 Chevette.  It broke down 12 miles from the dealer's showroom the day I picked it up and had to be towed back.  That was just the beginning of the problems.  I traded it for a Mazda GLC several months later and have owned nothing but Japanese cars since, with 2 reliable Fords in the mix.

1555,August 2015,markcincinnati,"My wife and I have been to Europe/Germany perhaps twenty to twenty-five times (some trips, not many, didn't include Germany, that is) -- we always fly into Munich, even if our destination is Venice or Zurich or even Vienna.  Of all of the European cities we've been to, Munich is the one where I think I could live AND work.  Much as we like Verona and Prague, and even Kraków (and what's not to like about London, Paris and even Brussles), Munich is THE city where I think I could work.  The train from Munich to Venice, via Innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and OMG in winter, as my friend says, ""If there is winter in heaven, this is what it MUST look like."""
1556,August 2015,dino001,"Yeah, the ED MSRP is 7 percent off base model US MSRP plus destination and options are priced at US MSRP.  It  makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller.  So for  example 50k base plus 5k options  plus 900 destination it is  52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings.  However, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that BMW sometimes throws for the US delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ED).  You can negotiate the price down from the ED MSRP toward their invoice just the same as US delivery (unlike Benz or Volvo, which have the ED prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it.  Don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but I heard of that several times.  I think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but I'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. There are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car.  Essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal."
1557,August 2015,dino001,"They probably should change the name, too.  While there is some brand equity left for older folks, I suspect people under 40 could not care less.  They need to rebuild, but their problem they don't seem to get it."
1558,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I thought the same thing---Cadillac should have had a new name 10 years ago, e.g. Toyota/Lexus. The Lexus name became gold-plated in about ten years time."
1559,August 2015,cdnpinhead,"Ah, the UAW.  Now I understand.  I spent several years researching the history of the U.S. steel industry over the decades after 1970.  Interesting stuff."
1560,August 2015,sweendogy,"I don't have a problem with the caddy keeping its name - problem is they kept its ways . No way an ATS and cts should be priced anywhere near its German comp ( not now). When people talk about what kind of deal they got on said caddy - nice job but car should be lower just given track record and current sales trends, given the time of year you can get 10% off a 3 series. Lexus did it right- time to start over again caddy. Would also add to the union stuff above - cannot believe the leader ship will let a potential collapse happen again in less then 10 years. Let's hope they are amarter."
1561,August 2015,qbrozen,I have to admit that I probably would never have even looked at the Caddy had it not been for the DEEP discounts they were offering at the time. So y'all are probably right that they should cut their prices to re-establish themselves. I just worry that they would take that as a reason to skimp on the car. This is a seriously nice piece of machinery with an impressive interior. It needs to remain that way.
1562,August 2015,circlew,"Exactly.  Now that they are serious, they need to come in under the competition from the start. When I walk up to a window sicker today, I walk away shaking my head. I don't want an anchor price that is in BMW/Merecdes range staring me out from the window of a Caddy.  Not gonna happen!"
1563,August 2015,dino001,"But then there is their cost structure.  How low is low and can GM make money?  I would bet Toyota didn't make much, if anything in first ten years of Lexus. That's why I'm not not optimistic about them, at all."

1565,August 2015,jeffm5,"Jeez, I've wanted a Caddy since I was 16.  I got my Medicare card this year, so I doubt it's going to happen.  I almost bought a CTS way back in 2005 when they were offering employee discount prices.  But the CTS was RWD only back in those days and we live in the snow belt.  I looked at an ATS in 2013, but priced with the options I wanted it was out of reach.  I ""settled"" on a Volvo S60.  Great car and very good dealer experience."
1566,August 2015,dino001,"That's essentially a full overhaul.  Add a name change for a good measure.  I truly believe they should try do ""a Lexus"", but I doubt they will."
1567,August 2015,qbrozen,"Think about that for a second, though ... there is a reason why Acura/Volvo is cheaper than Benz/BMW [and I'll add Lexus], and its not just because they choose to be. I'll give you a hint: it is also why the Lexus ES V6 is cheaper than the IS V6."
1568,August 2015,markcincinnati,"How about NOT lowering the actual sticker price but figuring out a way to get a bunch of the cars out there via the traditional sub-venting of leases.  I would think if you get enough cars out there AND they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (IF the reliability is there)."
1569,August 2015,qbrozen,they already include maintenance.

1572,August 2015,circlew,"Probably the reason GM started offshore production in the first place.  As soon as I hear ""union negotiations"", I think of the broken model that they had a chance to fix at bankruptcy but failed and claimed such a success....just kicking the can down the road."
1573,August 2015,graphicguy,"I've thought about this a lot.  Not necessarily the union aspect, as they're a shell of their former self, and wield a lot less power."
1574,August 2015,dino001,"I think the ""old GM"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics.  Law blatantly disregarded  - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor White House political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes).  This basically taught them wrong lesson."

1584,August 2015,sweendogy,"Maybe Gm needs to only sell GM branded cars- Gm corvette, Gm escallade ..etc. get rid of the massive dealership network and duplicate cars like Chevy small suv and Buick small SUVs. If they need to keep caddy / Buick name call the cars Gm Chevy impala or something. Massive overhead continues to kill companies. Now I understand and have read in the news that major companies ""reorganize"" at certain times like today's"
1585,August 2015,dino001,"Having only one well selling model makes Cadillac very vulnerable.  Think Acura - without MDX it's basically non-factor.  The cars may be good quality and even better value, but nobody cares.  RDX had a jolt recently, but I can't tell if it's sustained.   TLX, CLX and especially RLX are not selling, the last one will be a rare classic in ten years"
1586,August 2015,markcincinnati,Whatever Happened to . . . .
1587,August 2015,dino001,"Mark, if anything, the link proves that Subaru could be argued as a winner.  It holds its own against motor with extra  65 hp and two cylinders.  It cost 20 grand  less in total ownership, even though 2010 S4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially S4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category).  Yes, it is also nicer, but I don't see unquestionned superiority.  And this is still the pedestrian WRX, not STI, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so.  Extra stuff, better AWD.  I know, Audi has RS4, but adjusted for the money, Subaru does it better.  Engineering has always been a game of optimizing the variables to bring the value.  Take WRX against A4/A5 2.0,  see who wins.  And  WRX still costs less.  Even STI may cost less than A4/A5."
1588,August 2015,benjaminh,"Will the NSX, Acura's upcoming $150,000 halo car, help spur sales of more entry-level vehicles? That's the plan. Difficult to say if it'll pan out, but I think it will provide some pizzazz and buzz for Acura dealers. Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:"
1589,August 2015,m6user,"Well, both the Subarus and the NSX are not in this discussion topic. Subarus are far from luxury class and  a $150k two door coupe is hardly an entry level sedan."
1590,August 2015,roadburner,"Looked at the CPO 2013 335is today; still not all that enthused. I hate the 19"" wheels- more suceptable to damge, degraded ride comfort, and no performance advantage- so figure around $2500 for a decent set of 18"" tires and wheels from Tire Rack. The STI or Mustang GT PP looks better all the time."
1591,August 2015,graphicguy,"NSX has been a long time  coming. And, just like SH AWD tech, whatever is introduced in the flagship NSX will eventually make it to the lower level cars (like the Perf/Lux TLX)."

1593,August 2015,m6user,"So any cheap car with a big engine fits this category?  I thought luxury brands were pretty well  defined and Ford, Subaru, etc are not.  But I guess by some strange logic a Mustang is both a luxury car and a sedan."
1594,August 2015,nyccarguy,I'd like to congratulate
1595,August 2015,markcincinnati,"At this point, as I said, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most AWD systems, regardless of MSRP.  I do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many AWD systems -- unless they are of the FWD power biased flavor (my TL SH-AWD was FWD biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my Audis do not exhibit)."

Personally, I think it's one of the best looking cars in the segment.  And, that little turbo motor is a gem....comparable to the one in the BMW 528i or Audi A6 2.0 (actually, feels better than both)."

1603,August 2015,qbrozen,"2014 ATS V6 Premiums grab around $32k at auction. So figure somewhere in the mid $36k range retail. The 4-cyl Luxury models, however, are in the mid 20s, so high 20s is possible if you don't want a ""jacked out"" version and can deal with the base non-turbo engine."

1605,August 2015,qbrozen,A BMW 550i with roughly the equipment in a vsport premium is about $75k and trading for $51k at the auction. So it is pretty much on par for the midsize luxo market.

His car interest usually starts in the 7 figure range, he seems to admire the Bugatti Veyron.  My guess, he'll have one before me..."

1627,August 2015,roadburner,"My son is almost 21 and has a fairly strong interest in cars. He prefers performance cars but is patient and waiting until he is out on his own to get one. Currently he likes the M3/4, Cayman S, GT350, STI, and the Hellcat Challenger- as well as some true exotics. He has had a lot of exposure to the performance side, hanging out at O'fest with me and shagging rides in fairly quick cars such as a B7 press loaner and a GT2 RS."

Translation:  If I couldn't have an Audi, I'd have a BMW without any hesitation.  For some reason, I don't have the same feeling about the Mercedes models that are often compared to the Audi A4 and A6 lineup (or the BMW 3 and 5 series lineup.)"

In Europe, they have Skoda, Seat, VW models differing mostly by some styling and interior, but essentially identical otherwise (with ""special model"" exceptions).  Not as visible here, as VW to Audi separation is much more pronounced, especially within current US market offerings.  Other do much worse job of separating models, especially in lower end of the premium brands, where majority of their entry level models are barely changed in comparison to their close common relatives.  Lincoln MKZ/Ford Fusion, Acura CLX/Honda Civic come in mind, especially their lower level trims.   Even previous generation Audi A3/VW Golf GTI were not as far apart, as they should be."

1676,August 2015,graphicguy,Yep.  I'll say that all of those things (expendables) should be pretty obvious in their lack of replacement/repair with a relatively quick test drive and a quick look under the chasis and under the hood.
1677,August 2015,kyfdx,I think most luxury owners also cheap out... not just on their rental/loaners...
1678,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
1679,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Yeah, you're right, what I said at the OPENING of my post should have been repeated ""about half""-- yet, average just doesn't give enough information to know other than to take a guess that ""probably"" your 50% number (61) is ""probable."""

1683,August 2015,nyccarguy,I do to.  But the people who are paying $299 a month with $2999 down plus tax don't put PUG.
1684,August 2015,dino001,I think we are a bit special breed here.  More typical are those mentioned by NYC.
1685,August 2015,stickguy,I must be odd.  I have not had a loaner in at least 10 years.
1686,August 2015,Michaell,"Wow - I can arrange for a loaner at all three dealers I frequent for service - Hyundai, Subaru or MINI."
1687,August 2015,dino001,"Seems like those guys at Cadillac are even more removed from reality than we all thought.  Their sales are crashing, in segments that should bring growth,  they don't want to put incentives out, they raise prices, yet they want to sell 500,000 units by 2020.  They do say of a small SUV plans.  Hopefully more than just a rebadged Chevy."
1688,August 2015,Michaell,I think GM is starting to fall back into their old ways. Rebadged Equinox coming as a Buick; rebadged Encore is now the Chevy Trax.
1689,August 2015,stickguy,"well, the Acura dealer does offer them.  But in 3 years, I have never been in for anything that wasn't covered under the express service, so I never had to stay more than an hour, so no point in leaving.  Hyundai, well, that had 1 oil change, so I just waited."
1690,August 2015,robr2,Aw c'mon now.  These are more than badge jobs.  They are shared platforms with little shared outside of that.  Should we chastise VW for sharing an 8  year old platform between the current A4 and the new Porsche Macan?
1691,August 2015,Michaell,I suppose not.
1692,August 2015,dino001,"I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today.  It's about making cars different enough.  There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other.  A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC.  An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron."
1693,August 2015,markcincinnati,"It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive.  Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices.  Or did the competition creep their prices upward?"
1694,August 2015,dino001,"Where is Sony now?  Sony started higher because they used to have a product that was at least arguably better and most innovative.  Later on they stopped innovating, diluted the brand.  Sony is a shadow of its old self.  To wish Cadillac to go Sony way is to basically wish it to die slow and painful death."
1695,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Cadillac seems to be revising their pricing structure for 2016, so I think they're getting the message that they have to set a price about $10K below MB and Lexus."
1696,August 2015,dino001,Can you elaborate?  Are they lowering prices by large increments?  This would certainly be interesting news.
1697,August 2015,qbrozen,"Granted, I have not gone through the trouble of trying to build like cars, but the CTS starts at $5k less than the 5-series. The 6-cylinders start about $2k apart, so, OK, not so great there. But then you are back to a $5k delta with the V sport vs 550i. The CTS already starts nearly $9k less than its E-class counterparts."
1698,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
1699,August 2015,dino001,"Those all are too small differentials.  They should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at BMW or Benz, there is still a healthy distance to the STICKER of the Cady.  At least for now.  The CTS-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep.  The sticker shock from previous year was simply too big.  There is a history showing such big moves never work.  You can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years.  Lexus knew it and where are they now.  Even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the Germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models.  They have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."
1700,August 2015,robr2,"Back in January, Cadillac cut the MSRP on the CTS anywhere from $1-3,000."
1701,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Configuring a, for example, 5 series with X,Y & Z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a CTS is a good way to determine if Cadillac is going after the land grab."
1702,August 2015,dino001,"Lexus worked, because it was a separate brand. If Hyundai went as far as creating a new brand with separate dealer network, the land grab could work.  Selling 70K limousine next to 15K econobox is actually a very difficult proposition.  However, the former requires lots of time, resources and patience.  The latter can be tried and abandoned in one cycle."
1703,August 2015,nyccarguy,
1704,August 2015,flightnurse,"As someone who worked at Sony during the heyday, the writing was on the wall when I left in 97, every segment Sony was in, they had the top model, but when the walkman died, so did a lot of other products, Thier laptop's had many problems and durability was a problem, Sony wouldn't give up on the DAT player for Car Audio or BETA video recorder, two complete failures. Then Sony cheapened the brand by out sourcing products to be manufacturers in Mexico, other brands were getting better and Sony's products were getting outdated and finally other brands surpassed Sony in sales. If it wasn't for the PlayStation, I really think Sony would be a completely different company then it is today."
1705,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5.  The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan.  Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan."

1708,August 2015,stickguy,I sat in a new style C (used). Looked nice to me. Really liked the interior.

1710,August 2015,dino001,"So I guess the star on the hood overcomes anything.  Essentially nobody else can get away with that, not even BMW - their version of 328/335 with the plastic seat covers usually become lot queens, at least here (can't speak of 320, as those are obviously different kind of buyers, they may go for it much more often)."

1725,August 2015,robr2,Well Lincoln has brought their age down from 65 in 2012 so things are moving in a positive manner.
1726,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,Well that's good but keep in mind that age 61 is still an *average*.
1727,August 2015,nyccarguy,"MB always seems to have a decent amount of trunk money available.  Dealers purchase ""lot queens"" for their service department, punch them as ""sold,"" pocket the incentive money, use the cars for service loaners for 5K to 10K miles, & then sell them 6 months down the road for a good price compared to brand new at a nice, tidy profit.  My only issue with buying an ex-service loaner German car is the fact that you know the majority of people put RUG (87) in the car before they returned it even though it requires PUG (91+)."
1728,August 2015,robr2,Well the average age of a Bugatti buyer is 60.  Does that mean that only old codgers buy them?
1729,August 2015,robr2,"Since the computer adjusts for the octane, it really shouldn't be an issue."
1730,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
1731,August 2015,flightnurse,You have data to prove this?
1732,August 2015,kyfdx,"Anecdotal experience.. from all of the luxury buyers that ask, ""Do I have to run Premium in my XYZ luxury car?"", would lead me to believe that's true.."
1733,August 2015,nyccarguy,"No, I don't have any actual proof, but I just know how people are."
1734,August 2015,dino001,"I'd concur that there is a very good chance for it.  Similar with rental cars - I recently got a PUG Mazda MX-5.  After I refueled it with PUG (it was a long mileage rental), the car got much more lively.  I'm pretty sure it was full of RUG."
1735,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Only knowing the mean does not provide enough information to declare that ""about half"" of the buyers are old codgers. To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often.  The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish."

1740,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"He says really good things and really dumb things. He's a hip-shooter, so it's bound to come out badly now and then. Probably his worst gaffe was to challenge Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson on climate change on national TV.

1744,August 2015,dino001,"He makes sense, but only if they close more than half of the dealers and limit the production.  They'll run him from town first.  Too many vested interest.  No chance. This is a ten year program with constituance having patience for a couple of quarters."

1746,August 2015,dino001,"It's not about the age, it's about customer experience philosophy.  My feels is Cadillac's dealers are mentally closer to Toyota's, Vokswagen's than to Lexus's, or Audi's.

1752,August 2015,dino001,"The biggest issue I see is production cycle and spare parts.  While it may be cheaper to retool than it used to be, it is still expensive.  Moreover, by law of many countries the manufacturers have to keep spare parts of their models for many years, I think it is ten or so.  Increase number of variations and shorten the lifespan and the cost goes up, perhaps disproportionately."
1753,August 2015,nyccarguy,"Overall I'm not a huge fan of the current body style C-Class.  The baby S Class styling is too much.  I don't like the current S class styling either.  However, I've always got my eye open.  On my way to the beach this afternoon I saw a gorgeous black/black C300 4Matic Sport sedan.  It had the lip spoiler on the back, the sporty looking 5 spoke wheels, the led lighting package.  Very sharp looking.  So I just built one online.  Given that I'm a man of adding few options these days, I just opted for what I thought I needed to make the C300 my own.  $47K & change sticker price.  I'm sure the 241 horsepower turbo 4 would be plenty motivation for my purposes, given the fact that my daily driver pumps out a whopping 175 horsepower."
1754,August 2015,flightnurse,What options did you do?
1755,August 2015,dino001,"MB Tex may be looking upscale, but it ain't.  A friend of mine has an older C-class and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in Florida.  Combine it with absolutely ridiculous price MB charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and I have no interest in anything Benz.  I once entered building C-class, but existed at around 55 grand for C300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for C400.  No, thank you.  Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one)."
1756,August 2015,graphicguy,"Dino, I've been on a couple of test drives in the new C Class.  Pretty impressive, IMHO.  Certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch.  I do agree about the MBTex vs Leather.  Some say you can't tell the difference.  I certainly can, and it's not even close.  That being the case, the real leather of the one I drove with the sport seats was of high quality."
1757,August 2015,robr2,I'm too am not a big fan of the S Class shrinky dink styling.
1758,August 2015,tlong,"I also don't like the looks of the new C class. I've actually thought about getting  a couple year old C-class at a deal rather than the new ""ugly"" one new."
1759,August 2015,kyfdx,"I agree.. the previous one was striking...     It's like they tried to make this one look like the CLA, and it worked... it's not a good look."
1760,August 2015,dino001,"I think you're right.  Perhaps something changed, or I checked something too much.  It is low 50s, indeed, which is similar to a loaded 328.  BMW has galloped their prices recently well beyond what it used to be.  I remember being absolutely shocked first time I optioned one to a comparable equipment with my E91 wagon.  It was something like five grand more on the sticker and still couple of things missing.  Admittedly, mine was last year of production, with several options thrown in gratis, or well discounted, but still, the difference was enormous.  So I may stand corrected on this.  It is annoying though, when local Benz dealer in my area have absolutely no faith in their customers' real wealth, if all they order is MB Tex on C-class (also GLA, CLA).  Even E-class comes with MB Tex standard and large percentage of units on dealers' lots have it, which I find absolutely ridiculous.  It apparently works.  I wonder if that's something people don't realize until it's too late, or something people know, but don't care."
1761,August 2015,dino001,"I read once that BMW's styling is based on 3-series and it is ""blow-up"" to their bigger models, including X-series (except of course their smallest models), whereas MB is shrink-down from the S-class.  Apparently, the former works better, as it is easier to scale the aesthetics up than down."

1764,August 2015,roadburner,"I recently stumbled upon a 335is which had to be custom ordered; CWP is the only option. No DCT, leather, Comfort Access, navigation, or H-K. The perfect E91 for me."
1765,August 2015,nyccarguy,And?
1766,August 2015,nyccarguy,
1767,August 2015,sweendogy,for those talking caddy and messing with pricing you are spot on - the ELR is a perfect example of it- car is a rebadged Chevy and is 70k - I would bet I will never see another one
1768,August 2015,dino001,"Well, there is probably a decent separation between ELR and Volt in terms of almost everything, but motor.  However, it still does not get you to 70 grand."
1769,August 2015,benjaminh,My guess is that he was thinking that he was about the get the biggest payday of his life. I bet he's making several times what he used to make at Audi.
1770,August 2015,andres3,I whole heartedly agree.  Anyone who has ever had a car where reliability and durability caused great and frequent concern will always be very concerned with reliability and durability.
1771,August 2015,andres3,"The reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated MSRP selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease.  Someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore."
1772,August 2015,dino001,"I wouldn't be so sure that Audi, BMW, or Benz is much more reliable than Focus RS.  It might, but it might not."
1773,August 2015,andres3,"I think a big mistake was made keeping the Cadillac/GM names/brands around.  They should have renamed and re-badged everything to try and get a cleaner slate from previously burned buyers.  They should have followed the example set by GMAC, which became ALLY and they didn't exactly advertise the fact.  Change your name, don't use any letters from your previous name (OK; Ally uses the A in GMAC; vowels will be forgiven).  So think up a name that doesn't have the letters ""GM"" or ""Cdllc"" in it!"
1774,August 2015,andres3,"I agree, if Ford is smart, they'll ensure the Focus RS is reliable and durable.  If they don't give a damn, well, anything is possible.  I guess my main point is I'd be worried (and I think others out there too) about the reliability and support of a nearly $40K Ford whereas with Audi they've already gained my trust, and others probably feel the same way given Audi's recent growth.   I'd probably be worried about it with Benz too, a bit less so with BMW.  Part of the reason is BMW offers free maintenance for a long time.   The other part is I see a lot of BMW's at HPDE sessions/events and they don't seem to require tow trucks or early retirements during the weekend."
1775,August 2015,benjaminh,Over at vtec.net iutodd has compiled a list of luxury sales for the year so far:
1776,August 2015,circlew,"Well, GM knows not how to use pricing in their favor for cars...for trucks, yes.  They really aren't a car company anymore and Caddy is the proof they really struggle with that lost ""standard""."
1777,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,The only thing going into a ditch in the immediate future will be a number of Cadillac dealers. Heads are going to  roll pretty soon I think.
1778,August 2015,sweendogy,"Looking at the numbs above Buick jumps off the charts a bit- with that being said remember when gm cut the brand - lost Pontiac and 2 other brands that sucked. Ford sacked Mercury, Christler the worst of the bunch got rid of Plymouth and struggled only to be sold for pennies. The anticipation of a potential slowdown ... The problems with unions... The financial crisis bout to happen ... The end of the good old giveaways at dealerships.  gM has to smarten up. Slice a brand or 2 if needed....toyota prob will beat them to the punch again"
1779,August 2015,tlong,"Absolutely and I said this in these forums during the BK. The GM fans would still have bought the newly renamed GM, and the GM non-fans would be MUCH more likely to buy a vehicle from a revamped company that wasn't named GM. Remember Valujet? They renamed to AirTran and became quite successful until bought by Southwest, in spite of a bad crash and maintenance problems. The name change wiped a lot of the memory away."
1780,August 2015,tlong,"It's not just reliablity, it is also parts costs and dealer costs. While Ford's reliability has been pretty poor lately, even a more reliable German car could easily cost more, especially if you are out of your warranty period."
1781,August 2015,benjaminh,"Yes. It seems like some Cadillac dealers are literally begging for mercy. And it seems like they're not getting any. I imagine that low volume dealers in smaller cities have helped enlarge Cadillac's overall numbers for decades. But now management might look down at those dealers, which might not be glitzy, and might not have customers who can pay prices higher than BMW's for today's Caddys."
1782,August 2015,roadburner,"Precisely; besides, the RS will only be built in Der Fatherland!!!"
1783,August 2015,circlew,
1784,August 2015,benjaminh,"I wouldn't call Buick a luxury brand. And so, taking it out, here are the top 10 luxury makes in sales this year so far. The top 3 are quite close. I think it's possible any of them could pull out a narrow win for first place. Despite its big successes, it's a long drop to Audi, and then Acura is not far behind."
1785,August 2015,benjaminh,This is the fantasy that Johan de Nysschen has sold to GM:
1786,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Wow -- well, like they say, ""aim for the stars."""
1787,August 2015,nyccarguy,
1788,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Cadillac is going to have to excel in the entry level luxury segment--traditional Cadillac buyers are simply not responding to Cadillacs high end price structure.  Cadillac is hoping they will ""in time"" but how much time does Cadillac have?"
1789,August 2015,tlong,"It's going to take a lot more than a new advertising agency to help Cadillac. IMHO the brand, like GM and Chevrolet, is tainted by a lot of history. They should rebrand themselves completely."
1790,August 2015,markcincinnati,Crazy Miranda (Jefferson Airplane)
1791,August 2015,circlew,"nyccarguy - Q50 has been outstanding so far.  I like the infotainment and not too difficult to use after a few weeks.  Can't figure why heated seats don't come standard in the base model, though.  The S has brought me the sport suspension/brakes even though AWD and the sport mode tightens up the trans shifts quite nicely.  I chose the non-DAS steering.  Very nice package for $455/month lease, indeed.  Love the blip-throttle downshift, also."
1792,August 2015,dino001,
1793,August 2015,nyccarguy,"I love the way the Q50 S looks with those 19"" wheels and lip spoiler.  However, the higher trim package coupled with the absolutely horrendous road conditions here in the North East would steer me towards the base model.  I follow the ""lease questions"" board here and am amazed at how cheap these cars lease for compared to their MSRP."
1794,August 2015,circlew,"I agree the lease deals are great on the Q.  I originally shopped a used G37S RWD but before I could blink, it was gone!  Hard to find in stock RWD S models here in NJ."
1795,August 2015,tlong,I can chime in here. Two things - he was part of the GM failed management team and was always making excuses for their mediocre-to-shoddy vehicles.
1796,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
1797,August 2015,sweendogy,2 recent road trips 800 total miles mostly highway I have gotten a combined 29mpg. s4 25k miles. Car does a lot well.
1798,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Sween, my S4 does similarly -- better than the 2.0T I had (2009)."
1799,August 2015,roadburner,Most of today's turbo motors can achieve respectable mpg numbers assuming that they are matched with a vehicle with appropriate gearing. My Mazdaspeed averages north of 28 mpg if I keep cruise speeds under 80- that's with a tuned 2.3 liter making about 320 hp.
1800,August 2015,circlew,"This AWD Q50S is averaging 26 mpg highway/21 all around (keeping at 75 mph cruising).  Not great but acceptable for a 3,700 lb. sled."
1801,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Agreed, but the S4 is not turbo charged, rather it is super charged which ought to be less efficient one would think."
1802,August 2015,roadburner,"Well, yes and no; an SC engine uses some of the power the SC produces to operate the SC, but a turbo motor may-MAY-have more exhaust backpressure than a NA or SC motor."
1803,August 2015,flightnurse,"So Lexus did what I figured it would do, it has replaced the weak 2.5l V6 out of the IS250 and is using a modified version of the NX200 turbo 4. This past year when looking at SUV's we test drove a NX200 and wasn't all that impressed with the power it had, we both felt the BMW X3 felt faster.. The article I'm posting does not post 0-60 times.."
1804,August 2015,breld,"Certainly not surprising that Lexus is finally offering a 4 cyl turbo to compete with the other makes.  I do find it kinda bizarre that it will only be RWD, and the base AWD offering will be a de-tuned version of the V6."
1805,August 2015,breld,"Good to know.  With my wife's recent S3 acquisition, it has me thinking of a used S4 or S5."

1808,August 2015,benjaminh,Sales of some entry-level lux models for July:
1809,August 2015,markcincinnati,The ATS sales are particularly disappointing.
1810,August 2015,markcincinnati,"If you get a chance to read the new Road & Track opinion page by Bob Lutz, ""Go Lutz Yourself,"" I highly encourage you to do so."

1813,August 2015,benjaminh,"The new boss of Cadillac seems close to crazy to me. He thinks he can charge prices above BMW? Caddy seems to be in free fall. Sad. Although that has seemingly allowed a make I like better, Acura, to pass Cadillac, which I never thought I'd see...."
1814,August 2015,Michaell,ELR ... a rare sighting.
1815,August 2015,dino001,"Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes.  ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either."
1816,August 2015,dino001,"In luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. It's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't.  Others may have something similar, but not the same.  This is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options.  BMW used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their 3-series, just in the US market, this was before splitting off 4-series (I can't even imagine, how many you could have in Europe, when you have three times as many engines)."
1817,August 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
1818,August 2015,qbrozen,"I think some of what he said made sense, though. My takeaway was that he feels today's pay structure in automotive should favor the designer above all else. All of the efforts by the CEOs and CFOs pale in comparison to the effects the designers have on sales."
1819,August 2015,dino001,"Bob Lutz was a part of the spineless management of the old GM and even today he still wouldn't take any responsibility.  I saw him on Kudlow couple of years ago, asked why didn't GM change its ways before.  He responded that UAWs strike fund would outlast their cash pile.  I was truly disappointed when Kudlow didn't follow up with ""And whose fault was that?"".  GM was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right.  They should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the Union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s.  Some actually went bankrupt (Cummins), others went into long strike (Caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union.  But that would have been uncomfortable.  Perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while.  Who wants that, if you can pretend that nothing is wrong, do couple of faces to the cameras, like you are fighting those unions, then sign whatever they bring you and collect the bonus for a ""great job""."
1820,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Cadillac's push to raise the price of the CTS to -- I assume -- 5-series territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early.  A CTS at a 3-series price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. Those wanting a CTS/5-series sized car were, I think, heading to Cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what Lexus did from day-one?"
1821,August 2015,dino001,"Agreed - CTS price move should have taken several increments, not one big leap.  Hubris?  Miscalculation?   I wonder if they asked anybody who isn't their relative or on their payroll.  To me even a 12-year-old kid could have told them it was a bad idea.  Those corporate echo chambers are just like cable news shows - everybody nodding and reinforcing each other how smart they all are (which is obvious, as they all agree).  Then the reality strikes - elections for one, or sales of others.  Brilliant theories fall apart - but of course, nobody admits to anything, they all have ready twenty-five excuses, why people who voted against them didn't really mean it, or why people who bought something else were somehow duped."
1822,August 2015,qbrozen,"I wonder if it would have been any different had they simply named the ATS the new CTS and come up with a different name for what is now the CTS. Of course, then people would be up in arms that the CTS shrunk. Oh well."
1823,August 2015,markcincinnati,"I think, too, there is merit in the observation that Cadillac doesn't have enough CUV's to compete with the likes of Audi and BMW.  And, despite my own rejection of the notion of buying an X6 when I could have an even better equipped X5 were I to spend X6 money, well, BMW has the X1,X3,X4,X5 & X6 and some ""M"" variations to spice things up even more.  Cadillac has what, an Escalade?"
1824,August 2015,benjaminh,"Actually, Lincoln is now making a come back. Sales were up a solid 21% for Lincoln in July. They had their best July sales of the last 10 years. Lincoln is a ""value"" luxury brand. If they keep it up, and Caddy continues their misguided free fall, they might someday trade places in the sales rankings. This is actually a big opportunity for Lincoln for ""conquest"" sales from their long-time competitor."
1825,August 2015,roadburner,"As I've said before, Cadillac should have taken the Lexus route and priced their cars on the low side and only raise prices as the cars gained exposure and accolades."
1826,August 2015,markcincinnati,"Wonder if De Nysschen sometimes looks back at leaving Audi and thinks to himself, ""What in the wide-wide world of sports was I thinking?"" He was with Audi for 19 years and things were going along swimmingly weren't they?"
1827,July 2015,graphicguy,"WOW...interesting article.  Ikeda is the right guy for the job.  But, it's rare to see someone resign (get fired?) after several successful product launches and accelerating volumes like Accavitti did."

1829,July 2015,qbrozen,"I became a convert when the auto versions surpassed their manual counterparts in speed. I prefer pretty much anything that improves performance. I'm not completely converted, however, as I believe the majority of automatics are still inferior to their manual counterparts. There is no way in hell I would have bought a Fit with the CVT trans, for example. It also took alot of convincing to make the switch. I test drove the 135i with ZF 6-speed 3 times before coming to the conclusion that I could live with it. I grew to love it. (not the car, but the trans)"

Not sure why he left Infiniti, my guess is he wanted to live in New York City, not Hong Kong, but, I assume only he knows the full story."
1834,July 2015,markcincinnati,"If anyone was unhappy with their A4/S4 Q5/SQ5 A5/S5's Audi connect feature due to the limitations of the T-Mobile network (here in River City at least), my dealer loaned me an AT&T SIMM chip and coded my MMI to point to AT&T rather than T-Mobile and voila!  I am full-time in 3G and typically with at least 3 bars."
1835,July 2015,dino001,"But they declared themselves ""fixed"" after the bailout, so now they decided they could charge more for ""equal"" car.  Essentially, ""get 5 contender for the price of 3"" is not working is a luxury/upscale world.  That's downmarket commodity ""more for less"" world.  The luxury world is ""more for even more"", Cadillac thought they could enter that as ""equal"".  They problems is it doesn't work that way.  They should have crept the price over time, rather than slamming such a big hike at once.  Unless they were prepared for the volumes to crash and thought ATS would take care of that (it did not over longer time)."

Ricks GT will have the DHP, since all GT's are xDrive here in the states."
1858,July 2015,dino001,"The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life.  As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive.  Hence the ""con"".  There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western).  Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive.  Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines.  The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls.  The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault)."

It's a cool concept which seem more at place in the 3- but let's be honest given the choice...
1860,July 2015,Michaell,"The 3-GT is on a longer wheelbase than the 3-series sedan, supposedly to accommodate the Chinese market. Many owners are driven."
1861,July 2015,flightnurse,There is 3 inch more leg room in the back and the car is 1 inch wider then a 3 series sedan. The amount of leg room in the back is more then a 5 series sedan. The 5 GT has more leg room in the back then a standard WB 7 series.
1862,July 2015,sweendogy,"of the cars with 4/5 doors - if you had to vote one off the island, legroom aside it would be the GT every time. If I had to drive my 7 foot grandmother around it would be in the GT."
1863,July 2015,dino001,"I agree, GT is not really a BMW in the same way other cars.  I liked the general idea, but the execution was in a wrong direction.  Now, 4-series Grand Coupe looks fantastic and hits all the right tones - 440i GC (when it comes in 2017) is most likely going to be my next car - unless I decide I can't wait and get 435i GC."
1864,July 2015,stickguy,"I have given up trying to keep the BMW models straight. Confusing nomenclature, and seemingly ton of overlap between them."
1865,July 2015,dino001,"Grand Coupe is a 4-series because it uses 4-series wheelbase and wheeltrack.  It also has a rear hatch, which is a hoot to me.  I won't buy a car without a rear hatch.  The sloped rear is a downer for 6-ft tall individuals in the back seat, but I don't care - I sit in the front and don't chauffeur anybody around."
1866,July 2015,Michaell,"Yeah, if only it were so easy to remember ...."
1867,July 2015,roadburner,"For anyone interested, I posted my driving impression of the 2016 STI in the"
1868,July 2015,andres3,"What's not to like about the STI.  You should like it.  I guess there is one thing, you are forced to get a sedan rather than have the option to get the hatch version like the good ol' days."
1869,July 2015,roadburner,"Yes, I would prefer a hatch."
1870,July 2015,andres3,Have you test driven the Golf R?  I've heard reports that in real world driving it is faster than the STI.
1871,July 2015,roadburner,"I'd like to try a Golf R, but they are extremely thin on the ground. The local VW dealers can also be jerks- that quells my enthusiasm a bit."
1872,July 2015,andres3,"That is very true about them being thin on the ground.  And VW dealers seem content to markup sticker if they can get away with it, yet they sell anyway.    As to VW dealers being jerks, that's the rumour and the reputation.   The dealers I went to in So Cal (3 different dealers) were all reasonably accommodating and didn't seem abnormal.   Of course, 2 of the dealerships were owned by the same company."
1873,July 2015,circlew,"An interesting bit on the Q is the tire pressure monitor.  It shows the air pressure in each tire.  You can see the pressure rise as the tires warm.  Cool to start, typically rises from 35 - ~ 40 psi."
1874,July 2015,m6user,Many cars have this.  I do the same on my Acura.
1875,July 2015,roadburner,"I'm now on an Ohio BMW dealer's email list because they had a 135is I was interested in(before I came to my senses, but I digress). Anyway, today they sent me an email announcing that they were leasing 2015 320i xDrive sedans for $299-$399 per month- for 36 months with $0 down(10k mile/year). Not a car I'd ever consider, but it does sound like a decent deal for someone who'd want something like that."
1876,July 2015,Michaell,Local dealer here in Denver has them for $299 with $1799 down. Not enough miles for me and just a bit beyond my budget.
1877,July 2015,sweendogy,"On the comment above - I'm amazed dealers would markup ""hot"" cars and not just go with msrp. Seems like a dangerous game to play as they can piss off customers. If dealers Are really into satisfying customers for more then one car sale- if I went into a dealership and wanted a certain car (like I did years ago looking for an accord v6 couple, manual) and they up priced said car - I would never go back (which I didn't a few years later to get my wife's crv, but I did use there discounted price to get a better deal elsewhere)"
1878,July 2015,Michaell,"Dealers are simply striking while the iron is hot .. folks are willing to pay above sticker for the new hot thing. First generation Miata, PT Cruiser, GT-R are examples that come to mind."
1879,July 2015,carnaught,"I colleague of mine had pre-ordered a BMW i8 to the tune of about $200k.  Much later when the car came in they demanded an additional $50k over the MSRP.  He was incensed because this was non-negotiable, and they would not even compromise, plus he had to exert considerable pressure on them to get his deposit back.  They definitely lost him as a repeat customer.  He had been a repeat customer up till then."
1880,July 2015,roadburner,A few dealers pulled the same stunt with the Z8 and 1 Series M Coupe.
1881,July 2015,sweendogy,"I get they are ""striking, while hot"" but the next car a guy Who is now looking golf gti might be looking in 3/4 years time for a Passat or some suv - mainstream dealers are about volume- seems short sided to me."
1882,July 2015,circlew,
1883,July 2015,markcincinnati,"Wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?"
1884,July 2015,benjaminh,Jon Ikeda promoted to General Manger of Acura:
1885,July 2015,cdnpinhead,"The alphabet-soup transmissions are probably wonderful, so long as they work and/or are under warranty."
1886,July 2015,circlew,
1887,July 2015,sweendogy,
1888,July 2015,andres3,"I have to disagree.  The new A3 left me feeling it wasn't a ""no corner cut"" Audi.  I liked the lightweight chassis and tossable feel of the handling though.  The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for).   Also, it was a sport package equipped A3 I had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving)."
1889,July 2015,markcincinnati,
1890,July 2015,andres3,"There is a VW S3, but it's called the Golf R and has 5 doors.  The dealer that had one in my County didn't have it sitting more than a couple days before it disappeared into some happy buyer's garage.  Most VW dealers have zero.  Maybe the Golf 400 will be more readily available."
1891,July 2015,markcincinnati,
1892,July 2015,thebean,"In Texas, us old folks call tires ""casin's"" (casings)."
1893,July 2015,cdnpinhead,"The ""casin"" is the thing that you retread if it's a truck tire (max of twice), at least in my world.  Retreads on the drive axles only."
1894,July 2015,tlong,"What's with H-rated standard tires. When I bought my A4 in 1998, new, with sport package, it came with Z-rated Pirellis."
1895,July 2015,stickguy,"well, I can live with H, since I rarely get my car up over 130!"
1896,July 2015,markcincinnati,Top speed rating category doesn't give the full picture of the performance capabilities a tire will help your ELLPS or LPS car attain.
1897,July 2015,andres3,"I live in the San Diego Southern California region where snow is extinct and rain is rare.  I am still running stock 245/40R18 (Pirelli P7's Z-rated speed) Summer tires on my OEM wheels and will soon be trying 255/40R18 Extreme Performance Bridgestone RE-71's on my aftermarket 18"" wheels that are a 1/2"" wider than stock (and several pounds lighter).  Not because it is summer season, but because anytime a track event looms on the future horizon, I can just switch out, but I enjoy the extra performance on roads too, and not having to buy tools or spend time swapping them out myself at the track.  I think the stock Pirelli's fall under Max Performance, but they are just OK for the times.  They'll be replaced with Michelin Pilot Super Sports when needed."
1898,July 2015,markcincinnati,"I wish, sometimes, that we had SoCal's weather -- but, since we don't, and I am (or at least I must be) a lazy American when it comes to changing tires for Summer and Winter, I will continue with the best possible UHP A/S's that money can buy (based on the research and comments from folks here and on the TireRack's site.)"
1899,July 2015,sweendogy,Tires (mark brought it up not me)
1900,July 2015,Mr_Shiftright,we're waiting for the other shoe to drop......AND.....?
1901,July 2015,roadburner,"Dedicated summer and winter tire/wheel sets are definitely the optimum setup. That's what I run on the Club Sport, 328i, and MS3. The TJ and X3 run all seasons year round, but note that the Jeep's A/S tires also have the Severe Snow(winter) rating."
1902,July 2015,markcincinnati,"Roadburner:  Perhaps a bit of a word game, on my part, but I would say dedicated summer and winter tires are the MAXIMUM setup not the optimum.  UHP A/S are optimal, just not the maximum you can achieve."
1903,July 2015,sweendogy,
1904,July 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I'm a big fan of dedicated snow tires, too.  If you pitted a RWD or FWD car with dedicated snows against an AWD car with all seasons, it'd be pretty close. The AWD would probably be better on gaining traction for acceleration, but in steering, braking and handling I think the 2WD would beat it every time."
1905,July 2015,markcincinnati,If you live where there is routinely
1906,July 2015,zandor,"I prefer two sets of tires and wheels even on AWD cars.  AWD + winter tires = awesome.  The other reason I like 2 sets is I like summer tires.  If I get summer tires I need something else for winter, so I might as well do it right and get winter tires.  Around here (Chicago) the snow isn't usually too bad, so I prefer performance winter tires unless it's a RWD car.  They're much better on roads that aren't covered in snow than something like a T-rated snow and ice tire."
1907,July 2015,laurasdada,"As a life-long New Englander and skier of the beautiful Green and White mountains, beyond choice in drive wheels and/or tires, I find a major factor in handling driving in the snow is the fact that many drivers are just not that bright."
1908,July 2015,sweendogy,Love the tire talk and good to hear others are going the 2 set/season route - the cars we drive today have a boatload of safety tech built in but have added weight and power which can cripple you in a tough situation.
1909,July 2015,dino001,"This is not directly related to ELLPS, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars.  I just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position.  European Union is changing its stance on diesel emissions.  Up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels.  Their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process.  Moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines.  This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc.  Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug)  lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK.  This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics."
1910,July 2015,flightnurse,"Dino, you can take your stand and use it any car. Do we really need a 120K MB S600? Doesn't a 60K Lexus LS460 give the same ride and comfort? Just because you don't see a need for a diesel power Jetta doesn't mean others do not. Currently here in phoenix diesel fuel is roughly .30 cents less then regular unleaded"
1911,July 2015,dino001,"That's true, to each their own.  My point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because Europeans have them, so it must be so great,  but it turns out those Europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment.  Turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story.  The tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal.  Once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see European market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop.  It will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started."
1912,July 2015,sweendogy,
1913,July 2015,roadburner,"I found a couple of CPO E92 335i manuals while car hunting- both had xDrive, unfortunately."
1914,July 2015,Mr_Shiftright,It's just weight + complexity. What's not to like?
1915,July 2015,markcincinnati,
1916,July 2015,roadburner,"Plus, you don't even get a sport suspension. Most FXX cars at least offer the option of an adaptive suspension with xDrive. Without it the cars have a floaty ride and even more understeer."
1917,June 2015,billyperks4,<at transition.

1919,June 2015,roadburner,
1920,June 2015,flightnurse,"So to say that you are a little bias towards BMW, but to set the record straight, BMW does not import the 335d any longer, the 328d was it's replacement. If you want a wagon, it's either 328i or 328d."
1921,June 2015,circlew,"Maybe.  Gas mileage so far 21 mixed driving.  Sounds real nice on the down shifts. NVH is better than than previous iteration, IMHO."
1922,June 2015,jpp5862,"We have a Q50 Hybrid with 34k on the clock.  It's a great car, but the best description I've heard is ""Infiniti couldn't decide if they wanted to build a luxury car or a sports car, and they ended up with neither"""
1923,June 2015,circlew,I'd agree completely. Not a track day car but neither was the '06 330XI bimmer!
1924,June 2015,dino001,"There is no 335d for F30 model in the US market.  It was only E90 and IMHO that model was completely pointless (want a fast car, get 335)."
1925,June 2015,roadburner,"I should have known the 335d was gone, but after 32 years of BMW ownership and CCA participation my interest in the marque has decreased significantly; a couple of weeks ago I found last month's"
1926,June 2015,robr2,"Is that the case?  I went to the UK site to see and they offer in the diesel 316, 318, 320, 325, 330, 335.  No where could I find the actual engine size.  Does BMW actually make 6 different diesels in those sizes?"
1927,June 2015,dino001,"To confirm it, you need to look up the UK specs of their 320d and see that the torque and hp numbers are exact match for 328d US version (I did it for German version)."
1928,June 2015,flightnurse,"The 335d was a test car for BMW, it was infact their first diesel car in the use in over 30 yrs, E38 524td, was a good car for the time, but was pricey. So fast forward to the E90 335d, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and X5 3.5d. The 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the E90, and I think the 2 liter is too small for the F30, BMW has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more HP and about 50 lbs more torque. It would still deliver in the high 40s on the open road. That would take care of the power problem."
1929,June 2015,flightnurse,"I'll back Dino, our 328d is the euro 320d, same engine.. If they all use the same 2 liter, then it is all about tune.. Just like the our 320 and 328i."
1930,June 2015,dino001,"That's right.  However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size.  Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification.  However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick.  Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy.  Americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end  (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world."
1931,June 2015,robr2,"True but BMW has been playing the current badge = what the old engine performance used to do.  So the 335 has a 2.8 but it performs like the old 3.5.  It's definitely about ""prestige."""
1932,June 2015,dino001,"335 has 3.0, not 2.8, but the point is the same.  Now it will become 340.  Same size (3.0), more ponies so now (according to them) it is now like old 4.0 V8.  To a degree, it's true, but c'mon.  Now Benz is doing the same with their models.  C300 has 2.0 I4, C400 has a 3.5 V6, etc."
1933,June 2015,robr2,"C'mon is correct - especially for us OCD guys.  I feel the need to get a bunch of plastichrome numbers and ""fix"" all those cars.  Then Zen will be achieved."

1938,July 2015,markcincinnati,"(whispering) Pure Joy.  I can only imagine since I don't have the SD, but my wife and I took out an S5 w/SD recently -- it too had the 19"" wheel/tire package -- and it gave new meaning to the phrase ""corners like a snake in a rat hole."""
1939,July 2015,sweendogy,"Interesting I may try that- I do 40/40 all round - I don't feel the heavy front could be the SD but I would prob have to drive a regular side by side to comp. When I was looking I test drove one w/o SD and found it handle really well- it was set up with summer 19' slicks as well and I loved it, just couldn't match up on price. Mark Thanks for the talk on tires - when I swapped mine I was told this is the last summer on current set. Winters on the other hand have another couple of seasons- let's hope we (up east) don't have a similar winter or it will be less. This car really is a all purpose beast - in the snow with proper shoes (marks term) it's a billy goat- in the summer with slicks and in beast mode it's a rocket that can handle turns- not bad for a stealth kid hauler."

1949,June 2015,andres3,"I agree with your assessment.  In fact, I think the TL from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new TLX.   Although, to be fair, the TLX is available with a V6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced."

If you'd gotten a MB, Audi, or BMW back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. And I'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your TL ten years ago with the price of a TLX today.

1964,June 2015,breld,I buy whatever makes me smile. The badge or model number is never a factor. I don't judge the goodness of a car by the number of envious glances it generates or how well it telegraphs my disposable income to other motorists.
1965,June 2015,tlong,"Andres, thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I'm inclined to spend that much for the S4 although I'm sure I would enjoy it. Also isn't the A4 due for a redesign in a year or so? I'm curious to see what changes. Unfortunately I'm sure it will go up in price some more."

1967,June 2015,tlong,"I sort of liked the ILX. It was nice and all but actually the car I really used to like was the original TSX, before they bloated it up. I had those as loaners a few times and liked the interior, size, and agility. The ILX is nice but the styling inside and out isn't motivating me. I'm sure they are good reliable cars which would be the plus, but I'm thinking not very sporty. Honda/Acura seems to have lost that sportiness that they had in the 80s and 90s."

I checked out everything from a Mustang Bullitt to an X5 4.8is to an E39 M5. I finally decided to go with a FWD car since we were seeing so many Civic Sis, GTIs, Minis, etc.at our HPDEs- I figured I should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if I was going to instruct those drivers. The Mazdaspeed 3had received extremely good reviews from Automobile, AW, CD and R&T"
1970,June 2015,markcincinnati,"The V6 SH AWD ""version"" is, if you axe me, not a version at all, it is an entirely different car. Whatever additional tuning is performed on the SH AWD ""version"" gives it transformed handling (reminds me of an S4) -- and it is not (or perhaps I should say it can't possibly be just because of) the torque vectoring rear differential."
1971,June 2015,graphicguy,"Mark...I concur with you.  SH AWD, even in the TLX, is a ""horse of a different color"".  While not the performance beast the S4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects."
1972,June 2015,markcincinnati,"One of the things about the Q50 that I noticed -- having come from an FX with the same motor -- is a certain, er, ""coarseness"" (the pros call it thrashing) that the other Japanese and Germans lack.  Now, having said that, the 3.7L motor in the Q50 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening, but at full-cry the engine, which is still good, just shows its more unrefined side."
1973,June 2015,flightnurse,"For MY16 a similar options 340i is less then a MY15 335i. On the 340i LED headlights are now standard, BMW has shifted many items around, option packages have changed,"
1974,June 2015,graphicguy,"FN...looked for the 340 on TrueCar last night.  They don't have it listed yet.  I would imagine the lack of discounts on them is still going to put it above where I would want to budget a car/if I get a new car.  I mentioned before, I like these new turbo 4 motors. They are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. But, some are a little coarse.  BMW falls into that category (as does the one in the CTS)."

1976,June 2015,flightnurse,"The BMW build for the 340 should go live very soon, since the factory that makes the 3 series closes down for 2 weeks starting tomorrow, so people can't order a new 335 any longer, so check back middle of next week, also I can put you in contact with some sales people who will sell the car at invoice +$500, order your car, then pick it up at the PDC (Performance Delivery Center in South Carolina, and have a day learning how to drive fast, then take delivery of your new BMW and drive it home."
1977,June 2015,flightnurse,"If you bought the S4 to hold it's value you made a big mistake. I have 30K on my 320i and it's not even 2 yrs old, if you are worrying about mileage on your car, then next time purchase a Dodge Dart. Since your S4 has been in an accident, the value has has been depreciated already."
1978,June 2015,andres3,"Well,  I'd have to trust the wife with the pricey S4, and she doesn't have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles.  She's a good driver but I wouldn't trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I've been unsuccessful in getting her to try).  Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible."
1979,June 2015,andres3,According to the small claims judge the accident's diminished value was only worth $3K
1980,June 2015,flightnurse,"I think your priorities are askew, the accident will be the big issue not your miles when you go and sell it."
1981,June 2015,tlong,"I guess I always figured that unless somebody was leasing, I bought the car so I might as well enjoy it. I keep my cars a long time so I don't worry about limiting my miles, I intend to use the car to the maximum. Currently at 152K on my '05 Acura TL and will probably keep it another year or so. I would say drive the car and enjoy it (the S4) and don't worry about resale value unless that is something critical to you."
1982,June 2015,andres3,"I agree, I'm an Audi buyer and I wouldn't touch one that has been in a moderate to major accident with a ten foot pole.  Not without a big steep discount.  Luckily I can just keep mine long term as it turns out it has been extremely reliable not only before the accident, but after (less one coolant hose debacle).  The problem is (and the big difference is) you have some control over your miles (move your residence or buy an extra car), but you have no control over an accident that is in the history books, nor future accidents (not at fault) for that matter."
1983,June 2015,andres3,"Appreciate the input you and others here have given.  I guess life is too short to drive a 140 HP Civic EX Sedan 65+ miles a day over a 333 HP (underrated stock number) S4 Sedan.   Of course, I don't have much fun doing the typical route on the freeway being stuck behind mind numbing traffic.   However, as I've previously mentioned; I've found a very fun route home that doesn't cost much extra time but most definitely costs me extra fuel, brakes and tires.   I'll trade the fun for brakes, gas, and tires though; it's worth it."

1990,June 2015,tlong,"Well, I'm underwhelmed by some of the cars out these days. While I could afford a quite expensive car it is not in my current desire to spend more than perhaps $35K or so. My preferences are mildly sporty but nicely appointed smaller cars. So I'm thinking either a fully loaded Mazda 3 which handles really well and can have a pretty nice interior; or perhaps a used C-class. I don't find the Bimmers nice enough inside for my tastes. I'm ok with the current A4 but frankly don't want to spend that much - I found my '98 A4 at least as appealing as the current model. And I really lament the scarcity of manual transmissions and that is probably one reason that I'm not overly motivated by a lot of the available choices. I might consider something like a VW GTI but I'm not inclined to deal with VW and their parts and service again. I find the current Jetta a bore-fest."
1991,June 2015,andres3,
1992,June 2015,nyccarguy,"It is funny that you say that.  I feel the same way:  ""underwhelmed"" by not just some, but a lot of cars out there these days.  Nothing jumps out at me in the looks or driving department that makes me start thinking about how long until I'm even or have equity on the loan of my Subaru.  I look at the price I paid for my Subaru, the features it has that I really like (AWD, Heated Seats) and also what my monthly payment is.  No my car isn't perfect, it could use more giddyup.  I look at different cars and say to myself, OK this is nice, but not worth $X thousand more than my Legacy and definitely not worth $X more per month."
1993,June 2015,Michaell,"I don't know about that ... didn't that iteration of the TL have 225 HP? The Mazda, in ""s"" trim, has 185 HP. And, the power to weight ratio might be pretty similar."
1994,June 2015,graphicguy,"tlong....good points.  Only for a different reason, I keep crossing off cars off my list that might be interesting, but could be potentially a hassle to own.  My CTS comes immediately to mind.  Good looking.  Has all the ""right stuff"".  But, just a nightmare to own."
1995,June 2015,tlong,"One thing I forgot to mention is that I also looked at the A3 - while I do like my cars a bit smaller (I find my TL borderline too big), the A3 was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside."
1996,June 2015,sandman_6472,"Funny how we all have different tastes in vehicles. The wife really likes her A3 even better than her old Mazda3s which she really liked. As to being cheap inside, seems fine to us but it's the most expensive vehicle we've ever owned and our first German make...to be honest, if I had the funds, I would've gotten one instead of my Golf but feel like I got a 2/3 A3 right now. The smaller size of both vehicles was a major reason for purchasing what we did as we both like a small vehicle and we both got what we wanted here! Reliability wise, her A3 has been stellar unlike my Golf with 2 unplanned dealer visits in 5 months...can't blame the rims/tires issue on them really as I wanted the swap in the first place. Driving near the VW store this morning, saw the TDI wheels I originally wanted and still a bit pissed that they didn't listen to me but like what they substituted as I only see them on Jetta SEL models."
1997,June 2015,graphicguy,tlong....have you looked at the 4 cyl TLX?  Would that hit your budget?
1998,June 2015,flightnurse,How is it a nightmare to own?

2000,June 2015,andres3,"Think all the Big 3 stereotypical owner experiences everyone always harps on the Big 3 about and many think is   history but for some it is still current events and news.  Breaking news.   Is it 2015 or 1995?  His CTS is outgunning my Neon right now for Lemon of the Century.  At least my Neon didn't become a complete lemon until after year 3 was over by 1 day.  Even worse when I hit 36,000 miles probably just before year 4.   That being said, it did need to be towed the first morning after it's first night in the garage at home.  For balance, Dodge never told me they couldn't fix it."
2001,June 2015,andres3,"How's the mileage with the TDI?  Strongly considering a Golf SportWagen TDI for the wife.  It is winning out over the Forester, even the Forester XT with leather."

2005,June 2015,tlong,"Perhaps when I mentioned cheap inside, I'm also subconsciously adding ""...for the price"". I could get a stripper A3 for the low $30's, or a max loaded Mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (I think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. I might also consider a manual on the Mazda 3 if I could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the Audis."
2006,June 2015,tlong,"I did sit in the TLX and ILX recently in the showroom. I was surprised to feel that the TLX is really not so different in size or style than my '05 TL - a full 10 years older! The shapes are familiar, the interior still looks familiar, with the expected tarting up of LEDs, different fascias, bumpers, etc. My TL is like 250hp v6 and why would I buy a 4 cyl TLX for the same price or more than I paid for my TL? Too similar for my tastes and although the TL has been a great car, I guess I need a change and the TLX isn't it. I also find the TL/TLX just a bit bigger than I like and I want something a bit smaller and more agile. My TL is nice but a bit too much of a barge for me - which is why even our Mazda 5 feels so nice even though much less power. I'm looking for that tight steering and agility with some luxury. Power per se isn't critically important but refinement is more important."
2007,June 2015,markcincinnati,"That small CUV is a Q3 which we had overnight as a loaner -- very very nice -- too bad it is underpowered.  It seems to have the VW 2.0T version, not the Audi 2.0T what with its 220HP and 258lb/ft.  My guess is the Q3 will get the Audi engine SOON.  Of course, then I'd probably complain that it needs the 8-spd, being the kind of guy who is never happy (well, not really, jus' a little bit)."

Since ""no one"" never drives their cars with the screens NOT popped up, why aren't they integrated into the dash (like Porsche or the way Audi and BMW used to be?)"

2012,June 2015,graphicguy,Mark...asking you this question given how much you love Audi.  Am I reading correctly that the new A4s are dropping HP and torque to go to a less powerful 4 cyl motor?  That seems to fly in the face of everything the other ELLPS competitors are doing.
2013,June 2015,markcincinnati,"I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase.  We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too."
2014,June 2015,billyperks4,"""My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. """
2015,June 2015,stickguy,Volvo has gone to all 4 cyl. based engines now.  Even in the new XC90.
2016,June 2015,andres3,Don't they still leave the option for a turbocharged V6?  I seemed to see a few a couple weeks ago (T6 Drivetrain; AWD).
2017,June 2015,stickguy,"Volvo is phasing out the 5 and 6 cyl. engines.  the S60 is in transition, but the new XC90 is all 4 cyl.  Though variations of turbo, supercharged (or both) and electric assist.  so you can get a lot of power out of the little motor!"
2018,June 2015,sweendogy,For some reason I thought Volvo ceased making cars altogether. Good to hear they are still around and I hope the new interior dash actually has less buttons and more style.
2019,June 2015,markcincinnati,"Two Audis, the S4 and the S8 significantly outperform their MFGR 0-62MPH times -- but the published specs seem to suggest the S3 is, in comparison, the king of the hill next to the S4.  This, my dealer says, will not continue as of the 2017's."

2022,June 2015,sandman_6472,Wife's liking her new A3 and it has been flawless.  Got it's first oil change today and they cleaned it up nicely.  Very nice vehicle!
2023,June 2015,stickguy,"thanks to his Jetta, my son is firmly hooked on German cars (once you go German, you can't go back!).  Pretty much set that when his lease is up, it will be replaced by something else from the Fatterland.   Maybe a GTI or GLI, but he really has his heart set on an A3 of some sort."

While you only live once, this kind of mileage is racking up serious depreciation that my frugal side wasn't anticipating.  I think I might have the wife get a new car so I can use her '07 Civic EX sedan as my high mileage beater.   It also gets great gas mileage.   With the saved fuel, maybe I'll spring for the REVO Stage 1+ pulley upgrade kit that takes the S4 to RS4 levels..... and perhaps beyond...."

2031,June 2015,cdnpinhead,Ooooh -- burned.
2032,June 2015,andres3,"I often look at value.  When comparing the TL-SH-AWD to the S4, I think no one would argue the S4 isn't better, the argument comes in on whether it is 10,000 or 15,000 dollars better.   For me the answer was yes, in my opinion the S4 provided more bang for the buck ""value"" than did the TL.  A lot of shoppers probably go off of value, and if the best product presents a law of diminishing returns, then one might just settle on a lower priced option that isn't as good, but provides better ""value."""

2037,June 2015,m6user,You mostly thought it was great because it was cheap but still had a great feel to the drive.  Makes sense since you like german cars.  VW sales have not been that good as many people do not consider them great at all because repair records and crappy dealer experiences.  At that price point more cars are bought than rented(leased) and people are looking for low maintenance and repair and longevity.  They look at many of the Asian cars for that reason.

2039,June 2015,sandman_6472,"As a family that recently bought an Audi and a VW, we are happy with them even though my VW has already had an issue and had to go into the shop. Going in, I knew this could happen so I wasn't too unhappy when they came and let me know they'd be sending me home in a loaner. Today, I tried to charge my cell in the two power plugs and nothing happened, tried multiple chargers and nothing worked so will have to stop over tomorrow and see what's up. Thinking it will be a blown fuse at this point and hope it is...if not, we'll see how they handle it. Must say this kind of issue never happened with our Toyota's, Honda or Hyundai's but again, I knew going in with any VW product that there might be some issues to deal with. And with both the A3 and Golf being first year models, things do happrn!"

Assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of VW for the reasons you cite (and I am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. Since the cars' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, I can understand their waning sales.  Yet, this Jetta is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative.  Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged."

They went from an ancient low efficiency 4-speed automatic to CVT; not exactly progress.

When we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in.  Chicago, drive.  Cleveland, drive.  New York, fly.

2077,June 2015,dino001,"Well, I think it increasingly looks like Mark is belittling others' choices.  Seems like it's not enough for him that he wouldn't buy Toyota, he doesn't want you buy one, either - because if you do, the world will be in his words ""dumbed down"".  Those who don't care about great handling, but just want an inexpensive, reliable, made well-enough transportation from A to B should get their priorities straightened out, or else."
2078,June 2015,markcincinnati,"It is true, I hope for the stuff we humans produce to be great -- and I would hope everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy everything they experience and have at the highest level possible at a given price point."
2079,June 2015,m6user,"You simply are not going to get a great car, by YOUR definition , for the $20k that a base Camry goes for.  To most of those that buy one I would venture to say they consider it a great car by THEIR definition.  You can feel sorry for them for not recognizing excellence but I doubt they care. Self awareness is a wonderful thing."
2080,June 2015,dino001,"But again, how do you define great?  Some people could not care less how it drives.  Some people see great as super-reliable, low prices and low cost to operate.  That is ""great"" for THEM.  Who are you, sir to define what ""great"" means to THEM?"
2081,June 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Exactly. I could tell you all the reasons why my Mini Cooper S is a ""great"" car---compact, fast, great on gas, good-looking, room for a 6-footer, plenty of room for basic luggage & carrying stuff, solidly built, really fun to drive, easy to park, the perfect City car.....and yet, put another person in that same car and you might hear:  ""too small...I don't need all that power....I don't like the speedometer in the middle of the dashboard.....rides too hard....expensive to repair...mediocre reliability record....too pricey for such a small car...."""
2082,June 2015,roadburner,"Agreed, the same thing is true with home theater equipment, some people are happy as a pig in mud with a 42"" LED and an Insignia HTIB. Others aren't happy unless they have the latest projector,  four subs, and $15k worth of amps and processors. Everyone has their own comfort level as I see it.

2100,June 2015,dino001,"We talked here about Acura losing its way, not more precisely never really making it in this category.  The latest TLX commercial is a perfect example - lack of its own identity seems not enough for them, they had to invoke that idiotic German (catchy, but meaningless) tune.  The visual was actually not bad, but the tune simply idiotic.  They should fire those who authorized it.  There are many ways I could see TLX advertised, mostly as ""all-included"" luxury with a sporty slant.  The last message they want to convey is ""me to"" (as there is enough of existing perception of that), but this stupid German tune does exactly that."
2101,June 2015,stickguy,At least it is a really nice car. I was quite smitten with the one I played around in last week while at the dealer.
2102,June 2015,dino001,"I attended BMW's annual drive event (they do those every late spring in my area) at my dealership.  I like those, as you get a car without a salesman.  I drove 428i Gran Coupe and souped up 335ix with sport transmission and bunch of other options, all M-Sport related.  335 was fast, but I already knew that before, so it didn't overwhelm me with awesome power.  The new LCI steering update is just in time, as even souped up 335 still had that soft feel."

2107,June 2015,dino001,"I would not buy Toyota vehicle, although I noticed they improved their styling and interiors considerably.  In its own right, Toyotas are  actually great cars, they just emphasize things that are not important to you and ignore those that are.  If you ever watched Top Gear episode on Hilux (Euro version of Tacoma), you'd absolutely say that Toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours.  To hate Toyota  the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which I think is too far.  Some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance.  Toyota absolutely excels in those.  Those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else.  Those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom.  You may still hate them, but to say they don't make great cars is only an opinion, not fact."
2108,June 2015,m6user,"dino001, excellent points.  Lot of folks out there don't consider driving to be joyful but a chore in need of a tool.  A cheap but dependable tool."

2112,June 2015,dino001,"BTW, that Hilux episode of Top Gear was amazing.  They beat the snit of it, subjecting it to all kinds of abuses.  starting ""gently"" by numerous fender benders, escalating to more and more serious peril.  They submerged it in the Ocean by leaving the truck on a beach with highest tides in the world and the thing started afterwards.  They tried to kill it multiple times and it would not die."
2113,June 2015,jeffm5,"I currently drive a 2013 Volvo S60 T5, but have owned a Camry and 2 Avalons, the last one a 2005.  The Toyotas did what I expected of them - Provide good, reliable transportation.  The 2005 Avalon was a great highway cruiser.  Very solid and comfortable.  Fun to drive - Not so much.  I get that from the Volvo.  I guess it all depends on what you're looking for when you make the purchase.  At the time I bought the Toyotas, fun to drive was not high on my list of priorities, as I was building a career and raising a family.  I now have the option of indulging my fun to drive craving.  I still have a lot of appreciation for what Toyota offers to car buyers."

2128,May 2015,qbrozen,"I thought I read they intended to coexist with Fiat dealers. And I'm going to take a guess about your next point, which I think is a good one: If you want to be priced at and considered the same as BMW/Mercedes/Lexus, you'd better have your own dealerships."
2129,May 2015,dino001,"Looking at Alfa websites, they already have dealers there.  Those in my area are same as Fiat, which are part of multibrand franchises.  So all it will do is add another nameplate and probably a separate showroom (perhaps not immediately)."
2130,May 2015,thebean,The Fiat dealer close to me (McKinney TX) already has an Alfa sign on the building below the Fiat sign.  Should be above it but maybe they are waiting until some actual Alfa's show up.
2131,May 2015,robr2,There is only one Alfa dealer in MA and it's owned by Herb Chambers that has about 60 total locations.  The address of the Alfa dealership is across the street from the Fiat store.  He has a Maserati store about 30 miles away in a hoity toity suburb.

2135,May 2015,dino001,"Sport suspension IS NOT standard, read again.  328/335 has standard current Sport Line aesthetic elements and seats.  You can get previous standard seats on 328/340 by getting premium package and luxury line (which is no cost) To get M-sport suspension (2VF adaptive or 704 regular), you need M-sport package or track package.  However, they did say they have ""newly tuned"" the suspension and steering.  If that delivers, it may be OK in standard form."
2136,May 2015,carnaught,"BMW has to upgrade their interiors, especially the dash, IMHO, as Mercedes interiors are now light-years ahead."
2137,May 2015,dino001,"Agreed.  Not only Mercedes - Audi, Acura, Lexus.  Pretty much everybody is ahead.  However, to be fair, upgrade different inlays make big differences on the interiors.  However, the instrument cluster is still a  1980s."
2138,May 2015,markcincinnati,"dino001 - I would disagree with ONE of your ""is ahead"" selections, and that would be the Acura. The Acura interior, while probably able to be applauded for its tech still seems to show its Honda-ness too much.  In fact, the Acura and Infiniti interiors, today, just seem a lot cheaper looking than those from Audi and Mercedes.  The slow-but-steady improvements in BMW's interiors since 2010 or 2011 certainly bears noting; but today the two Germans I noted certainly seem to offer best in class interiors."
2139,May 2015,andres3,"I think the 2011 or 2012 and older Mercedes C-Class had a more Honda-like interior than Acura.  Granted, it improved in either 2012 or 2013, but before that, yuck!"

2141,May 2015,roadburner,The Louisville Fiat dealer has an Alfa sign up as well.
2142,May 2015,flightnurse,Dino you are wrong....
2143,May 2015,flightnurse,Here is the ordering guide to show you Dino (and I highlighted) that the sport suspension is standard.
2144,May 2015,dino001,"There are three types of suspensions: standard, M-sport (704) available on ""i"" models with both ZMP and and ZTR and adaptive M-sport (2VF) available on ""i"" and ""x"" models with same packages.  S-line is standard, indeed, but it was changed to not include 704, just like it didn't on ""x"" models.  I stand by my statement.  The standard suspension will be retuned to be more sporty, but that's not sport suspension."
2145,May 2015,stickguy,"man, BMW has gone off the rails with this stuff.  between having about 20 different models, and these endless (and convoluted) option configurations, it could take a math PhD with a cray all day to figure out what to order!"
2146,May 2015,roadburner,No word yet on whether the LCI F3x 3ers will need a new battery at every Oil Service...
2147,May 2015,markcincinnati,"Just curious, what with the discussion about BMW's ""endless"" combination of options, etc: How many folks  [here] buy/lease cars ""in-stock"" vs ordering and waiting?  In my experience, the only person -- besides me -- I know who ""always"" orders her German cars is my wife."
2148,May 2015,roadburner,"I sometimes ordered my new BMWs(and once needed my salesperson to go to the mat with Munich when BMW wanted an ""optional"" sunroof to become mandatory), but the crux oof my complaint is that BMW still bundles some options. It's fine to offer packages that combine popular options at a perceived ""savings,"" but I wish that BMW would take a page out of Mini's playbook and make every option available individually. I suppose it's a moot point for me; after 32 years of continuous ownership(not to mention years of service in BMW CCA at both the chapter and national level) I've almost totally lost interest in the marque- I recently sold one of my BMWs and will likely cull at least one more from the fleet."
2149,May 2015,graphicguy,"Funny thing...I've heard people complain when they don't have enouhg options to craft a new car with the exact options they want, and others who complain about having too many options.  Can't win if you're the manufcturer, it seems."
2150,May 2015,robr2,"No doubt, Herb has great business.  I bought two Hondas from him and felt the pricing was fair.  As the biggest dealer in the Boston area, it's natural for him to be the biggest advertiser.  At least he's not pretending to be working in the service department like Ernie Boch.  I've looked at some used cars from Herb with smart pricing and checked over at Real World Trade In Values and the numbers are pretty much on target.  The service at Honda is reasonable for basic things."
2151,May 2015,flightnurse,"No that is only on the 550i... I sort of laugh at the guys who beat their chest about owning one, then come to find out that the N63 engine has major problems, that can run up to 10K to fix (but BMW has stepped up and covered the cost with a retro fix.) Now the dealer has been replacing the battery in them too at each service.. This is why I believe the 535d is the best choice in the 5 series line up.."
2152,May 2015,qbrozen,"I'm all for packaging options, as long as it makes sense. I really don't want to deal with all individual options, especially on the used car market."
2153,May 2015,flightnurse,"I ordered my E46, didn't on my 320i, we are ordering Ricks GT, as well as my next BMW. BMW last year 2014, did 22K  European Delivery's at the Welt last year (this includes people from around the world, not just in the US.) that number is up from the previous year. BMW BMW does more European Delivery then MB and Audi. Of course BMW dealers really don't push this, as they too want instead sales, as well as the SA... But it appears more and more people are doing it."
2154,May 2015,flightnurse,"I have been told that Porsche really is flexible when it comes to ordering from them, just because the website does not allow it doesn't mean you can't get it your way. The same with BMW, just have to ask."
2155,May 2015,dino001,"It's all relative.  In their home world they have more then twice of engine choices, with option numbers just mind-boggling. American price sheet for the 3-series is three or four pages, the one in Europe is a 30 page booklet. So, in fact, American ordering is very simplified when compared with other markets. It's of course reflected in the pricing.  I also know they run a system with dealers in full control of the ordering options within allocations, as opposed to many other manufacturers, who often push their choice of options on dealers.  This of course means that people like me, who have taste outside of the ""mainstream"" are still at mercy of Joe, the dealer's ordering manager, but at least they allow to order anything that's on the list."

In the ELLPS class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear.  If you lease a German car, these days, it often comes with MAX performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces."

2186,May 2015,Michaell,"And, how many Alfa dealers will there be? Co-located with the Fiat dealers or separate?"
2187,May 2015,andys120,"I lived in Manhattan for 8 years (Upper East Side) and parked a car on the street the entire time, doing the Alternate Side Tango the whole time.  In retrospect it seems like insanity but then I am CRAZY about cars and I did get good use out of it.  Like most Manhattanites I went out of town most summer weekends."
2188,May 2015,andres3,"I suppose it's cheaper to rent if you are only doing it a few weekends a year.  You'd have to buy all the extra overpriced insurances, since you have none since you don't have a vehicle."
2189,May 2015,andres3,Anyone in Manhattan living out of their van and parking space? Do they ban camper/trailers?
2190,May 2015,robr2,"If one rents a couple of weekends a year, it's not that expensive.  Or one joins ZipCar.  It's $35 a year for a membership and about $30 a night on top of the regular rate to keep a car overnight.  That includes insurance."
2191,May 2015,robr2,"RV living in NYC isn't that uncommon and it's not illegal.  As long as the vehicle is registered and not illegally parked, it's allowed."

2193,May 2015,tlong,"Well, in the book ""The Millionaire Next Door"", the basic idea is that an awful lot of people who look rich are not - they are just highly leveraged. Conversely a lot of people who look of very modest means are quite wealthy. They're wealthy partly because they save and invest their money rather than spending it all over the place on high profile items."
2194,May 2015,andres3,"Instead of jetskis, boats, yachts, snow skis, snowboards, skate boards, snowmobiles, ATV's/buggies, and other toys, I choose to divert my toy fund towards my vehicle.  Heck, my last video game console is the GameCube."
2195,May 2015,billyperks4,Here we talk about ELLPS and not old Camrys or individual net worth.
2196,May 2015,laurasdada,"Good, as I have neither..."
2197,May 2015,graphicguy,Touche.....
2198,May 2015,andres3,"I once saw the rainbow unicorn of cars.  A recent model Toyota Corolla ""S"" model being driven like it was an autocross modified Miata on a time trial run, but on a public back road that has plenty of curves.  This guy kept up a very healthy fast pace in front of me for a good 7 miles or so,"
2199,May 2015,billyperks4,
2200,May 2015,stickguy,It already was. They call it the ES350 and sell it at Lexus.
2201,May 2015,Michaell,"Bzzzz ... sorry, the ES doesn't qualify as there is no ""P"" in it. ""ELLS"", sure."
2202,May 2015,dino001,"Plus, I heard it's not a Camry anymore, it's Avalon."
2203,May 2015,Michaell,"OK, a Camry that's been through the Medieval Rack treatment ..."
2204,May 2015,andres3,I think Toyota has plans to install the V8 from the IS-F model into the Camry or ES and will call it the Camry Hellcat.
2205,May 2015,markcincinnati,"Go on, pull the other one."
2206,May 2015,cdnpinhead,Nothing Japan (let alone Korea) ever produces will be worthy.
2207,May 2015,qbrozen,"Oh, come on now. Back when it was new, the G35 was a competitor. They could do it again. Not sure it will qualify for this category, but that upcoming Infiniti sedan with the GTR running gear could be interesting."
2208,May 2015,ctl,"Sorry to sidetrack the conversations. To me camry is just a reliable transportation that could have been any of the sort. Not about individual net worth either, as there are people much wealthier and driving lesser cars. Just that I think they are probably not interested in cars to begin with."
2209,May 2015,flightnurse,"To some people a car is an appliance, plain and simple. Get's them from point A to point B, they know that they will have to replace said appliance every 7-10 yrs with another appliance these people are happy with what they drive. However, some people in their forum can't wrap their head around this concept, just like on bimmerfest, some guy was very insulting to people who have a 528i and 535i, because in his small mind the only 5 series worth having is the 550i."
2210,May 2015,flightnurse,So here is a video of the new XE with audio of the engine...
2211,May 2015,laurasdada,If only the XE was available New Year's Eve 2013!
2212,May 2015,flightnurse,WOW... did everybody fall off the face of the earth?
2213,May 2015,billyperks4,Enjoying my F10- getting familiar with the many functions of the I-Drive.
2214,May 2015,andres3,Here is my recommendation to everyone here.
2215,May 2015,flightnurse,"Highland Valley Rd is a great road, also going out to Bates Nut Farm is a good one too. But the real run is going up Mt. Palomar on the south side (we called it the tight side)"
2216,May 2015,andres3,"Any highway you can find that is designated as a State Route (ie. SR-# or S-#) is fairly easy for thrill seekers to find.  Roads..... now that's much harder to find.    Mt. Palomar falls into the S-route category, but it is a great one.  The tight side is more like the ""west"" side though.   Either way, you'll encounter many sport bikes enjoying that road, and unfortunately if you are driving spiritedly, you'll inevitably come up behind a Toyota or other absurdly slow vehicle climbing the very twisty switchback grades."
2217,May 2015,andres3,"Can we add the new Volvo S60R T6 that has similar (but falls short) numbers to the S4 to the list.  Was at about 45K dollar wise, but I didn't get to drive it as it was indoors."
2218,May 2015,markcincinnati,News: Audi B9 coming -- but not exactly soon . . .
2219,May 2015,graphicguy,"I saw the BMW announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models.  I always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with.  That said, I had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which according to BMW, upped the HP and torque ratings by about 20 each.  So, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine.."
2220,May 2015,dino001,"Totally agree.  I think their general interiors are not so bad, especially when you go for some of the optional items, such as wood finish with real leather, but their dashboard and instrument cluster feels 30 years old."
2221,May 2015,spidpooy,How do you guys compare Infiniti Q40 and Subaru Legacy Limited 2.5 with eyesight ? They are both almost cost the same to me. I know that Subaru is not Luxury car but The Legacy comes with all new technologies that other Luxury brands cannot offer in this price range. But Q40 is almost 5 years old technology with crash prevention technology at all. The interior of both are Leather. Of course Q40 is 3.7 and more performance and fuel hungry....
2222,May 2015,billyperks4,When was Cable TV added to the luxury list?
2223,May 2015,nyccarguy,"Having driven a Q40 in it's former G37 guise and owning a 2015 Legacy 2.5i Premium, I can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles.  I can offer you a few pieces of advice.  1st, if you like the way the Legacy drives, then stay away from the Infiniti dealership.  Just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local Infiniti dealer and see if I can trade in and break even on my Subaru (13K miles since 9/27/2015).  Power from the Q40's 328hp V6 is plentiful while I'd describe my Legacy's power output adequate."
2224,May 2015,carnaught,"Not sure what the ""Eyesight"" option is on the Legacy.  Is it some pre-crash alert system?"
2225,May 2015,spidpooy,Eyesight package include:
2226,May 2015,spidpooy,Thanks a lot. You mentioned extra horsepower is a plus for Q40/G37... To me that is a secondary since I should have to pay more for gas on Q40. Its MPG is low. Is there any other plus in Q40 compared with Legacy that you can imagine ?
2227,May 2015,roadburner,"Wow; if I was a totally moronic and incompetent driver the ""Eyesight Package"" would be a must-have!"
2228,May 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Remember the old 1980s joke about how Volvos were built for people who hated cars? Well maybe all these Eyesight gadgets are for people who hate driving?  (and sometimes when on the road, I wouldn't blame them btw)."
2229,May 2015,roadburner,"The eyesight gadget fans not only hate driving, they also seem to take pride in the fact that their driving skills are abysmal; ""Why adjust my mirrors properly? Why practice situational awareness? Heck, why should I look past the end of my hood? Let the car do all that."""
2230,May 2015,carnaught,The Subie's Eyesight seems like a great safety feature.
2231,May 2015,laurasdada,"GG, the red XKE roadster of my father's friend is what led me to the lair of the Jaguar!  For your next chronic car buying experience, you should check 'em out, not your father's Jag.  Man, the XE is getting some great press so far."
2232,May 2015,markcincinnati,"The above is the spirit and some of the actual words I wrote.  Most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, TV and so on.  More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make  -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever).  The thing is very few of us can ""have it all.""  And, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all.  My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car.  He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car.  He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for.  He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am.  This guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old."
2233,May 2015,andres3,The best collision avoidance system (or Eyesight) is a good attentive driver.
2234,May 2015,carnaught,"On paper, agreed.  Problem is we all get tired or a level of distraction.  Some help countering this could be helpful."
2235,May 2015,flightnurse,"You say that now, but when you are running late and need to check messages, oh, yeah people on this forum don't do that..."
2236,May 2015,flightnurse,"In regards to the standard sport package on the 328's, there is talk that the sport seats might now be standard. Of course some people over on BF are splitting hairs on what the press release says. Not everybody wants those sport seats, so to force people to have them, would drive people away from BMW... One thing I'm waiting to see is how much is this new Premium package going to be, since it now comes with LED lights. LED lights on other BMW's is a $1900 option, and currently the price on a 328i is $3100. So $5K is very steep, and some people could careless about the LED's for $1900,,,  I would have liked to see Xemon being standard on all BMW's, even the El Cheapo 320i.  But until the ordering guide is released (hopefully next week) we wont know for sure of prices."
2237,May 2015,flightnurse,"The 340i gets the new ""B"" series engine, so hopefully there will be a MPPK for this engine and Exhaust which would give the car roughly 370hp."
2238,May 2015,dino001,"My understanding of the release is that everything but suspension from Sport Line will be standard on 328 - and I love it.  I also have a concern about premium package pricing (and 340 as well, since premium pack features will be standard there).  LED prices went down, but I'm sure BMW would like to keep the margins, if only let by the market.  Seems like they're going away from HID lights altogether, for obvious reasons - green commies from Europe and America hate those, as they'd rather you poison yourself with mercury from CFL than use couple of kWh more; CFL doesn't work for headlights, so LEDs are next ""best"" thing)."
2239,May 2015,dino001,"I wonder how their muffler looks like.  If they drove 8 blocks to work in the middle of winter, there is probably only rusty shell left - you touch it, it's gone into dust."
2240,May 2015,nyccarguy,"Basically power, performance, & handling are the Q40's major advantages.  It's all what you put stock in.  I happen to like all that stuff, but didn't exactly have the budget when the lease was up on my 2011 BMW 328xi.  I also do a lot more driving than average (over 20K per year), so leasing gets pricey."
2241,May 2015,andres3,Don't people in NY ever go on road trips????  Rent a car I suppose?
2242,May 2015,robr2,Not everyone goes on road trips.
2243,May 2015,flightnurse,never said they drove it 8 blks
2244,May 2015,flightnurse,You never watched Seinfeld.
2245,May 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"The cost of a parking space in Manhattan per square foot is about the same as the cost of an apartment per sq. ft.  It's not uncommon for parking spaces attached to condos or co-ops, to sell for $225,000, because only 1% of this type of building has parking.  Some people buy parking spaces as real estate investments in Manhattan."
2246,May 2015,stickguy,common in the city is renting a car for the weekend when they need to go out of town.  Much cheaper than owning and storing one.
2247,May 2015,dino001,"Neither would I, but I'd like to see percentage of those sold into fleets vs. retail. Also, the fact that ATS is even less, if baffling.  Must be a real dog at the moment - and the car isn't so bad.  I think the right people haven't found them yet. Looks people likely to like ATS don't even bother to come and look at it."
2248,May 2015,Michaell,Any numbers for the Q40? I think they should be added to the Q50 numbers.....
2249,May 2015,roadburner,Yes the ATS is a great car that is being ignored. It doesn't broadcast the proper image for the wearers and the enthusiasts unjustly write the car off- associating it with the AARP Specials the marque used to crank out.
2250,May 2015,nyccarguy,Looks like a new addition is coming to the ELLPS family:
2251,May 2015,markcincinnati,"Someone here wrote that the German practice of a new model designation (with Audi it is B, C, D, etc)  is to release a new model every 8 years with a ""refresh"" at year 5 or 6.  This is a practice that, I assume, comes from the desire to amortize development costs (and, in theory, lower the MSRPs) over a long time horizon."
2252,May 2015,robr2,"I'm the one that wrote about VW's long product cycle.  I have a B5 Passat.  It was available for 1998 to 2005 - 8 model years with only a minor facelift in the 2001 model year.  In today's competitive auto market, a car can't stay the same for that long."
2253,May 2015,thebean,+1. Not everyone worships at the altar of German cars.  Some of us would rather drive Honda's and retire early than drive fancy-schmancy cars.  To each their own.
2254,May 2015,dino001,"It's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe.  It also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less.  No dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash.  The incentive may or may not be extended.  This alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage."
2255,May 2015,markcincinnati,I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.
2256,May 2015,m6user,"Millions buy a Honda or Toyota because it is all they can afford, they are not ""settling"". It's hard for some to understand that it seems.  Some even aspire to same."
2257,May 2015,graphicguy,"I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area.  As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago."
2258,May 2015,roadburner,"I'm not slamming Hondas-I'm going to give the upcoming 300 hp Civic Type R a good hard look-but if you pick the right car and service facility you can run a ""fancy-schmancy"" German car for little more than it costs to run a Honda- witness my 318ti and my son's X3. That said, a Japanese car is my current favorite for strafing back roads-but then it's a bit of a hooligan sled."
2259,May 2015,laurasdada,"Jag, huh?  Whoda thunk it?"
2260,May 2015,nyccarguy,Interesting choice of engines too.  a 2.0L Turbo Diesel 4 cyl & a 3.0 Super Charged Gasser V6.  Talk about spicing up the segment:)
2261,May 2015,laurasdada,Pace without diesel clatter grace!
2262,May 2015,billyperks4,Laurasdada
2263,May 2015,flightnurse,"A 2L turbo gas will come 6 months later, btw its the Ford Ecoboost 2L."
2264,May 2015,markcincinnati,"We all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing.  And, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the Honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an Acura.  They settle for the Honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ELLPS or LPS.   Things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds."
2265,May 2015,m6user,"You just don't get it.  I know we all ""settle"" or make compromises, but many people actually buy used cars until they can afford that shiny new Honda which they have wanted for years. And no, they can't afford an Acura.   Saying they can afford an Acura or maybe an Audi but have settled for a Honda makes assumptions that reflect a real disconnect.  Isn't it possible that some have ""settled"" in other areas just so they could buy their new Honda?"
2266,May 2015,graphicguy,Mark.....all good points.
2267,May 2015,kyfdx,"Plenty of people ""settle"" for Accords and Camrys, because they don't see the value in the luxury makes, not because they can't afford it..   It's just not important to them."
2268,May 2015,roadburner,
2269,May 2015,graphicguy,Yep....!
2270,May 2015,laurasdada,"It's the wife's, base.  She chose it over the E-Class because she found it to be ""sportier."""
2271,May 2015,laurasdada,"My son, somewhat quoting Clarkson, is disappointed that I ""settled"" for a Jag as I couldn't afford an Aston Martin.  Although, at 16 and soon to be licensed, he feels I should give the Jag to him."
2272,May 2015,robr2,"You find that in many major cities.  People don't own a car because they don't have to.  Everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door.  In NYC, you might consider having one if one lived in Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten Island.  The further away from Manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car."
2273,May 2015,dino001,"It's not just that.  It seems they are repackaging things.  It still depends on the prices, but I actually like some of the moves - 340 (more hp, so they can bump up the number) gets premium package standard, which is how it should be - I just hope the price differential between 328 and 340 won't get prohibitive.  They get Sport Line aesthetic features standard into 328 (SEATS!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board.  There will also be track package, not really my thing, by I understand why some will go for it.  I bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option."
2274,May 2015,billyperks4,"""It's the wife's, base. She chose it over the E-Class because she found it to be ""sportier."""
2275,May 2015,andres3,"I actually test drove the 2.0T ATS and the 3.6 ATS and both didn't have enough grunt to steer me clear of the S4.  There were other things too, but that was one of the main problems.  Obviously, I'm sure the ATS-V would solve that, and while the real world selling price might be competitive, last I checked the stickers were ridiculous (I last checked in 2013)."
2276,May 2015,andres3,"I bet you many of those millions have a 800 dollar smart phone financed over a 2 year contract.  Cable TV, and other luxuries they felt was more important than ""affording"" something more than a Honda or Toyota."
2277,May 2015,flightnurse,"The sales of the current Passt is higher then the last Gen, the previous Gen passt was too expensive, just like the Jetta. I too liked the previous Gen Passt, felt more like an Audi then a VW. I think this is why VW has a hard time selling the CC, it's expensive.."
2278,May 2015,dino001,"I was aware of that.  Current situation is a result of years of ""streamlining"".  I probably should have chosen Toyota as my example, as those guys have much more elaborate option structure, yet the ordering mindset is just like Honda's, not BMW's."
2279,May 2015,dino001,"It's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop.  Because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it.  The consumers know it, so they adjust behavior accordingly.  Of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"".  The gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course."
2280,May 2015,dino001,"Honda and Acura are at least honest about it:  some things simply don't even exist in their catalogs. I can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there.  The problem is, others (Toyota, Ford, Mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable).  BMW and Benz will usually gladly take an order.  It seems VW dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as Roadburner said, ""cold fusion"" difficult."
2281,May 2015,tlong,Well they seem to be having a hard time selling what they have out now. Their sales are down and way below targets.
2282,May 2015,dino001,"VW's problem was they alienated their old customers, but initially gained some ground on their cheaper and dumbed down models, but ran out of steam.  My guess is people figured out that if you want a Corolla clone, better get the original.  To me VW is a cautionary tale to BMW.  You may have an early success, such as a new Jetta and Passat had, but this doesn't guarantee long run."
2283,May 2015,roadburner,"VW has never really understood the US market since the days of the original Rabbit. The one constant has been their ""Throw it at the wall and see if it sticks."" marketing strategy"
2284,May 2015,robr2,"As a VW owner and an active member of a VW forum, I feel that I can speak to some of their issues."
2285,May 2015,dino001,"In ither words, they are too slow.  BTW, great description, LOL."
2286,May 2015,Michaell,"Excellent summation,"
2287,May 2015,henryn,
2288,May 2015,henryn,
2289,May 2015,robr2,"The strong dollar does make exporting the Polo cheaper but would it be cheap enough?  What happens when the dollar weakens and then VW is losing money on every Polo imported from Spain?  Perhaps if the next Polo (MK VII) moves onto the MQB platform, then it can be made in the US or Mexico and be profitable."
2290,May 2015,henryn,
2291,May 2015,robr2,"Honda has been well known for that since the 1980's.  Honda is well committed to the minimal trim lines within a model and then options are dealer installed model.  It seems to work for them just fine and in reality, I find that most people would rather have that than a dizzying array of options to choose from.  Further, it makes driving it home today much easier."
2292,May 2015,dino001,You can't make multiyear decisions based on six months of data.  It has to work also when dollar is at levels from year ago.
2293,May 2015,Michaell,So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?
2294,May 2015,dino001,"That could be an option, but considering all costs, generally low volume and pricing centraints of US market, small cars are tough.  It's not an easy decision to bring such a vehicle to here."
2295,May 2015,flightnurse,"IT works for them because the buying public allows it to happen. What would happen if Honda's sales would drop say, 13% a year and market research shows that people want to be able to order their cars? Would Honda change?"
2296,May 2015,stickguy,"you still can't get anything you want with a domestic.  Maybe some more packages or stand alone options.  But Honda has been this way for a long time, so not likely to change.  Very efficient.  And frankly, now that sticks are pretty much out of the mix, about the only issue is regarding the moonroof (mostly wanting leather, etc. without one).  Other than that, you can get pretty much what you want."
2297,May 2015,robr2,So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?
2298,May 2015,robr2,"If that were to actually happen, which we all now is highly doubtful, Honda might change - or they might not."
2299,May 2015,flightnurse,"How about color choice? As I posted if you want a top level Accord, hope black is your favorite color as that is the only color. Anything from EX-L up is limited in color too.. Not too sure what you mean by, "" you can get pretty much what you want.""  In the domestic market you can order separate items, but the trick is finding a dealer that is willing to do it. Ricks father only buys buicks, he just bought a Enclave which he ordered and was able to get stand-a-lone items that where part of a package... So it can happen.."
2300,May 2015,tlong,"I would have no problem paying a somewhat premium for a Teutonic (and it doesn't even have to be made in Germany) driving vehicle with a really nice interior - you know, like the early 2000's Jetta and Passat. What I'm tired of (and I owned a Jetta in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. High parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. So I really liked the late '90's/early 2000's VWs and nearly bought a Passat as it was much like my '90 Audi A4 - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ELLPS. Fast forward to the later 200x's and the Passat is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. It's more like an American car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and VW service network.

2302,May 2015,andres3,"Agreed 100%.  How can I choose a color if I haven't seen it in person; paper and monitors often don't come close to replicating actual colors.

2309,April 2015,dino001,"I think that claim of your friend's is based on observation that many of his purchases are based on customer walking in and buying without testing.  What he doesn't see, or account for, are customers testing first in any location, then going home, sending emails and setting up transaction with the best offer, which may not be the place they actually test drove."
2310,April 2015,markcincinnati,"dino -- good point, I would, however, say that his observation perhaps at least suggests folks don't test drive as much as they used to (or as much as my wife and I do NOW.)  I'd say my wife and I are really oddballs, in that we test-drive new cars as serious hobby-ists.  I like to think, however, we don't test drive cars we're pretty sure we'd NEVER buy. Of course there was that one test drive of a new Lincoln crossover, what were we thinking?  The thing had a horrible suspension -- reminded me of driving a full-size van (where we live, down by the river.)"

He goes and pretends to be interested in a new S-class just so he can ""experience"" it.  Too me it's embarrassing, but he doesn't care.  He always creates some fake justifications, how this pretending is not in conflict with his proclaimed christian faith (like ""I may be interested in this car in 20 years"", or equally ridiculous notion).  Well, he does those things with (justifications) with other things, too - so I'm used to that hypocrisy by now."
2313,April 2015,henryn,"I really don't see any ""hypocrisy"" in any of this.  I have test driven many cars that I did not expect to buy.  And at least twice during my life I have purchased something that I never thought I would purchase, based primarily on that test drive."

""The story"" was for the external consumption.  BTW, this is just part of his behavioral pattern, so the hypocrisy thing is just endemic to him in many other aspects of his life.  Not that I'm free of it myself, I just admit it when it's clear (he doesn't)."
2315,April 2015,markcincinnati,"My wife and I certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving.  But there is actually a legitimate purpose too.  Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy.

The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops.  The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it.  The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions.

2324,May 2015,roadburner,Back in 2007 I was planning on buying a new GTI for my next HPDE instructor car; the local VW dealers acted like ordering a car was more difficult than achieving cold fusion so I walked and ended up with my MS3. A true blessing in disguise as I've since heard that the local VW dealers have a firm policy of refusing to hire service technicians with opposable thumbs...
2325,May 2015,dino001,"LOL, Roadburner.  I think VW had one of the most inconsistent dealer networks out there.  From absolutely horrible to first class and all in between.  My observation is that it all depends on the parent corporation.  If it belongs to a same place where premium German cars are sold, it's usually a very professional and nice place, not necessarily cheapest, but pleasant.  Cross-pollination with fellow BMW or Audi usually helps.  However, if it belongs to one of those Hyundai-Kia-Toyota-VW-fill-the-blank stores, the experience is not so great, probably for the same reason.  Attitude toward order may be exact result of that - if company culture had already ordering on premium brands, it's no big deal to do that on lower end brand as well.  However, if special order has never been on vocabulary of a Kia manager (not picking on them, just an example), when he moves to a VW store, he is not going to change his habits."

2354,April 2015,dino001,"Bingo.  There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything.  That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved.  Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want.  One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"".  I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months.  ""Why would you wait?"", they asked."
2355,April 2015,robr2,The vast majority of Americans want their new cars TODAY!!  Waiting 6-12 weeks isn't the norm.
2356,April 2015,dino001,
2357,April 2015,stickguy,"Also without ordering, many people still pick what they want. Just rpthrough dealer swaps or incoming allocations. So you can wait a few days at most and get pretty much anything."
2358,April 2015,m6user,"We do it because we can.  Simple as history.  If there were megalots of cars sitting on every corner in Euro cities they would be doing the same thing.   They order because they have to.  In Europe the car dealers probably took over the space where carriages were custom ordered.  In the U.S., the car dealers just built facilities on the next 10 acre vacant lot in the suburbs.  It's just a different way of doing things and for every anal car addict that posts  here(and I don't mean that derogatorily) there are thousands of people who look at cars as transportation.....even those cars costing $70k.  They just consider them just more luxurious transportation.   I'm pretty sure cars a less expensive in the U.S. and people turn them over a lot quicker than they do in Europe on average.  If I knew I was going to keep a new car 10-12 years and it cost me a lot more I may be a tad bit more picky too."
2359,April 2015,dino001,"Depends.  It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited.  Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations).  Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null.  I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching,  dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels.  No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO.  There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many.  Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply.  Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration.  It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships.  I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand.  I disagree, but who am I?"
2360,April 2015,markcincinnati,"Good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. My wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 BMW X3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate MSRP discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, I don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees."
2361,April 2015,dino001,"It's not about Europe being ""Oh so special"".  It's just a statement of fact that in the US we pay much less for cars, but in turn we have to accept limited choices provided by the manufacturers (like only 2 gas and 1 diesel engine on 3-series sedan, even less choice on other body styles, no manual transmissions, etc.), which is even more narrowed by dealers due them stocking only what they believe they can sell quickly - and customers wanting to drive away with the car at the day of the transaction, not in six weeks, not even in next day, or two.  It's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. Again, I don't blame them, just stating the fact. The reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic.  In overall, I'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week  - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course"
2362,April 2015,stickguy,"Dino, isn't the 4 GC by definition a rarity, so easily within the 5% margin?  You are likely pretty unique in terms of what you want, so certainly should order.  But that doesn't mean the majority of buyers aren't getting what they want by settling."
2363,April 2015,m6user,"One, new home construction hasn't been over a million per year in years.  It may be that someone actually pays more for cars than housing over a 30 year period but IMO it would be exceedingly rare.  I pay more in real estate taxes alone than I pay for my present 3 vehicles per year.  Equating a home purchase with a car purchase is apples to oranges at best.  Americans can and probably should be ridiculed for many things but the way they buy cars should be way, way down the list."
2364,April 2015,dino001,"Agreed on that one.  Yes, it would suck, if the car died.  However, the arrangements can be made, like buying a cheap car for time being (it is of course much more hassle, but I once almost did just that).  I also think there are ways to prevent most of sudden deaths of vehicles, at least maintenance-related.  An accident or act of nature with a total would be one that may not be fully preventable."
2365,April 2015,robr2,Depends as you said.  Local MB dealership has:
2366,April 2015,dino001,"That is exactly my experience, too.  I had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life.  Another example is dynamic handling package or 3/4-series.  Sounds good, especially on X-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and M-sport lines.  NOT A SINGLE unit available with that, across the board - 3-series, 4-series, sedan, coupe, whatever.  ZERO. How do I spend, or not spend $1000, if I don't even know what it actually brings?  The significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act."

2373,April 2015,flightnurse,"So this past week, the windshield cracked on the BMW, When I got home called the dealer to see what they charge, was quoted $635 for the Windshield, and seal, then labor at $172/hr x 3 hours ($516) for a total of $1,151.. Of course the service manager is telling me how important it is to have the window replaces at the BMW because as he put it, he has seen some horrible jobs which cost the owner thousands of dollars to repair.. We have gieco for insurance company, and have zero deductible, but they will only pay $40 an hour for labor.. So I contacted Safelite, my quote complete with a BMW windshield was $634, this they came to the house and replaced it. It was interesting to hear this guy talk, he and another guy only do high end cars and they are the ones who go the dealership and do them.. So the dealer was going to make $500 bucks by having someone else do the work..."
2374,April 2015,robr2,Very true.  Few dealerships have the ability to change a windshield.  They just sub it out and mark up the price.
2375,April 2015,kyfdx,"I just caught a rock a couple of weeks ago...    My BMW dealer actually does windshields, which I didn't know until I called them for a recommendation."

2377,April 2015,flightnurse,"Rick had his windshield replaced on his Geneses twice, the first one was so distorted that I was surprised that the installer from safelite even installed, that was replaced the same day, his second one was OEM  and didn't have a problem. So I'm not too sure if that makes a difference or not but I wanted OEM glass installed."
2378,April 2015,roadburner,"My dealer's service department is one of the primary reason's that I've stayed with BMW as long as I have. My Service Advisor never tries to push unnecessary repairs or service and will tell me up front if a less expensive alternative is available. And, since my SA and a couple of the sales guys are HPDE junkies, I have never had a problem with warranty coverage on the cars I track."
2379,April 2015,sda,
2380,April 2015,nyccarguy,I know we've spoken at length here about modifying cars via ECU reflashes and such.  Certain manufacturers are lobbying to make it illegal to modify your car's computer.
2381,April 2015,markcincinnati,"There are ""chip"" providers that do provide a warranty -- far as I know, though, most of their products are NOT approved by the MFG's.  Volvo has partnered with Polestar and cars chipped (from the factory, of course) by Polestar are covered by the OEM warranty.  I don't know if Dinan has any formal relationship with BMW that somehow protects a customer with a Dinan modded BMW from financial ruin.  I don't think StaSIS modded Audis carry an official Audi warranty, but cars so outfitted by StaSIS do have a full warranty and there are actual Audi dealers who retail from the ground up StaSIS outfitted versions."
2382,April 2015,roadburner,That's very odd; I believe that Dinan uses piggyback tuners on those cars. I've run Dinan and Conforti chips in pre-OBDII Bimmers with no issues at all.
2383,April 2015,flightnurse,"Dinan and BMW work closely together, and if you have any Dinan work at an authorized Dinan shop, it is covered under the factory BMW warranty. My 330 had many Dinan upgrades to it and never had a problem. My piggy back on my 320 has been flawless, not one problem, no code issues. Now if I had a M5 and was having issues after upgrades, I would take those upgrades off and want my money back... No fun having a car like a M5 sitting in the shop.."
2384,April 2015,flightnurse,"The other issue I have with Dinan is the price, Dinan just came out with a new line of Electronic tunes for the F cars, starting at a low price of $1500... My tune was $357..  The Dinan tune is to make 237hp for the El Cheapo 320i, the claim doesn't whether it is crank HP or RWP."

2387,April 2015,markcincinnati,"How is it that a power-plant that outputs, say, 250 pound feet BEFORE chipping and 340 AFTER not putting stress on the transmission originally designed for the original torque output (with some margin built in for durability)? The thing is, such upgrades of blown engines often do produce massive torque improvements (at low RPM's) -- and initially there usually does not appear to be any negative consequences of the added twist.  But, over time, won't the transmission almost be expected to have a reduced lifespan?"
2388,April 2015,roadburner,Maybe it's to cover the warranty exposure; who knows?

2390,April 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
2391,April 2015,flightnurse,"This is an excellent question, maybe BMW and Audi have one transmission that is used in all of thier cars, maybe the 8spd in my 320i is the same as used in the 550i, if so then the transmission can handle the extra power and torque.."
2392,April 2015,kyfdx,Do you really think so??
2393,April 2015,roadburner,"The 8 speed ZF(8HPxx) is used in a lot of different brands and depending on the model it can handle anywhere from 332 lb-ft to 665 lb-ft of torque. That said, the F20, F30 and F10 get  the 8HP45, which is not as strong as the 8HP70- which sees duty in the F01, E70, and all the Chrysler/Dodge Hemis save the Hellcats(8HP90)."
2394,April 2015,flightnurse,So the F10 550i gets the weaker transmission?
2395,April 2015,roadburner,My mistake- the 550i gets the 8HP70- as do all the BMW V8s.

2407,April 2015,dino001,"It's true, but they were ones who shouted from rooftops how great their product was, worth paying the money.  So the crowd came, but BMW decided the services of shouting are no longer required.  They may be right, for now.  It's more important if in say ten-twenty years, when nobody shouts and people buy because they got a good deal, BMW goes Acura's way.   It's easy to imagine that.  Acura was also on the rise, until it was not.  They basically have two models of consequence - MDX and TLX, and the latter one is still not close in popularity to old TL.  I don't know, we will see."

VW learned the that lesson the hard way; after receiving all sorts of accolades for the Mk I and Mk II GTI, the Mk III and Mk IV were hammered for being soft and uninvolving.

2424,April 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I think we'll find that as the driving situation on American roads becomes more and more awful, the cars themselves, and their drivers, will continue to adapt to this new environment. The Model T Ford succeeded by paying close attention to the roads it was going to be used on, and I think the modern car is rushing headlong into providing a) safety b) convenience c) comfort, over any ""thrill"" of driving.  Your average driver of a new S5 will never push the car to anywhere close to its capabilities."
2425,April 2015,markcincinnati,"Completely agree.  In fact, MOST drivers, not just the average one's will never even come close to what a lot of cars are actually capable of doing."

2444,April 2015,qbrozen,"So, before I comment, I need to know why you feel the sport pack makes a difference in such a comparison. I mean, the adjustable magnetic ride control on my CTS is generally regarded as superior in any comparison, so you can't be talking about suspension. I'd give the nod to the BMW sport seats, so maybe that is all you are referring to, although I can't imagine calling 2 cars in different leagues based on just that."
2445,April 2015,billyperks4,"Brozen-I am not knocking the Caddy, all I am trying to say (and this is just me)  the 5 is just a nicer car to own all around. My tv/audio installer has the CTS and quiet frankly it is a nice car but its just not ""me""."
2446,April 2015,roadburner,"I fitted the 2.3 DI turbo in my MS3 with a low restriction MS intake as well as an extremely conservative ECU remap; while the N55 does produce appreciably more torque below 2800 rpm, from 2800 rpm to 6000 rpm the 2.3 cranks out 20 lb-ft to 44 lb-ft more torque. Which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. In my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and  my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves I can refer to the MS3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face."
2447,April 2015,qbrozen,"Well, certainly. But I can at least admit they are in the ""same league,"" sport pack or no."
2448,April 2015,qbrozen,"My 135 was definitely fast, especially after I added the tune, downpipes, and intake. But the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the Caddy's feels. For example, if I was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the CTS. Of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that."
2449,April 2015,roadburner,"Displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. In my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers."

Can't really make that connection.  I think the build and materials might actually be a little better in the CTS vs the 5.  You don't see it that way.  No problem for me.  That's why they make all sorts of different cars, models at all kinds of price points.  Plenty of choice for everyone."

2462,April 2015,roadburner,Just recently talked to a long time BMW enthusiast; he has always owned the latest and greatest M3 or M5- and even crewed on a BMW LSR attempt. He told me that he now drives a CTS Vsport. I asked him why and his answer was:
2463,April 2015,cdnpinhead,So I guess it's not just me.
2464,April 2015,dino001,"That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often.  My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary.  One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing.  Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy.  It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs.  It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience.  We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years.  As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded."
2465,April 2015,robr2,I'm guessing that BMW's monthly check was bumped up a bit.

2472,April 2015,m6user,"I love the way that many people literally accuse these mags of accepting bribes to slant reviews and then turn around and use these same mags as sources.  Count the ads???  If you make the accusation why don't you count the ads and prove your point.  I'm not naive but I tire of the off the cuff indictments without ever citing any actual proof.  The mags might not always be right but ""monthly checked was bumped""?  Please."
2473,April 2015,dino001,"I read the same thing this weekend.  Quite surprising, even for me - and I'm not a GM fan by any stretch of imagination.  Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again.  I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up."
2474,April 2015,dino001,"I'm with you - it's really too easy to throw such an accusation, especially on a board like this.  I wonder, if Joe Smith, a poster would say such a thing so quickly and loosely, under their name on camera on national television, so GM and C/D lawyers know where to send a complaint.  If so, what would be a length of a legal disclaimer before or after such statement followed of course by another one from the station itself."
2475,April 2015,dino001,"I just looked at a random ATS incentive.  They have 750 loyalty, but 1500 conquest cash.  Way to go - tell your current customers they aren't as valuable, that you like these BMW owners more."

2490,April 2015,tlong,This. I don't really want highly bolstered fully adjustable sport seats -- but I also don't want couch seats in my car. Audi is certainly failing here and it sounds like BMW is as well. Funny how years ago it was the high end cars with the good seats and the plebian cars with the flat seats. Seems like it has reversed.
2491,April 2015,dino001,"Those 3-series sports seats are not highly bolstered.  They ain't Recaros, if you know what I mean, nothing crazy.   They are just well-bolstered, as opposed flat ones in the standard version.  To me they should be standard, especially in a model that sells itself as ""Ultimate Driving Machine""."
2492,April 2015,robr2,I have to ask - was it also shared expenses?
2493,April 2015,roadburner,Exactly!
2494,April 2015,tlong,Agreed!
2495,April 2015,markcincinnati,"The best seats I have ever had are in my current 2014 Audi S4; my wife's SQ5 seats are about 99% as good as my S4's, too -- before that, I enjoyed excellent seats in:"

Then it will be followed by the usual laundry list, such as said RFTs, lack of manual transmission, or nicer sounding engine (pertains to lower end 3-series) and less expensive (which is true for all cars and brands).   Now, that may not be ""better"", but I liked it more.  Doesn't preclude me from buying it again for simple reason that others don't make what I like, either."
2505,April 2015,stickguy,"Well acura came out in 1985. Audi was pretty humbled back in those days. I'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand."
2506,April 2015,andres3,"Maybe, but I although I can't speak to the ILX (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), I can speak to the TLX with an extremely similar drive train; which I've test driven twice now."
2507,April 2015,markcincinnati,"dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don't actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines."
2508,April 2015,dino001,"To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste.  BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus.  I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him.  Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money.  BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more."
2509,April 2015,markcincinnati,"Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward)."
2510,April 2015,andres3,"I think you've hit the nail on the head.  If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership."

2513,April 2015,laurasdada,"Mark, et. al.  When I used the words, ""further humbled,"" my thinking was along the lines of the effect of the Japanese mfgs. moving upmarket and the perceived value propositions of the German marques to the general public.  I believe, and certainly more so due to the original Lexus LS after Honda fired the first shot, that the Germans were a bit surprised by the reviews and acceptance of the fancy Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans."

2516,April 2015,markcincinnati,"The thing that ticks me off with the Audis at this point is that the best seats in the house are, for mere mortals (financially) in the S4 with the upgrade option, mine in red!  To next experience such chairs, you skip over the A6 and go straight to the S6 -- which, let's get real, usually is tickling the underbelly of $80,000."
2517,April 2015,roadburner,"The base seats in my wife's E36, E39, and E83 were fine for all but ""brisk"" driving; the E90 base seats are more like park benches. In Europe the sport seats are a standalone option, but in the US you have to get the Sport/M Sport package. Fine for me, but my wife doesn't want/need the staggered summer rubber or the M Sport suspension(which admittedly feels a bit brittle with RFTs)."
2518,April 2015,dino001,"I'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of 3-series and 4-series buyers are there for the badge.  I said repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me.  many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace.  I'll admit that F3x standard seats are improved over E9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard.  I simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. What's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""Luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option.  That is truly pathetic.  Now I hear Audi has gone same way?  The world is ending, no doubt."
2519,April 2015,dino001,"I always made fun at American manufacturers that they had no clue how to make a decent car seat.  It was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainstream here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". Just a look at an old Chevy, Buick, or Ford (GM was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt.  Seems American public learned since then and so did the manufacturers."
2520,April 2015,dino001,"I believe there is an option for all-season non-staggered tires with Sport/M-Sport package.  I don't know if dealers order them, but it is possible to order.  You can also get a ""normal"" suspension with those, just get x-drive (in this case, Sport/M Sport turns into pure aesthetic package plus seats).  To get sport suspension with x-drive, you need to pony up another $1000 for their adaptive M-sport stuff.  So there is a way to get good seats without firm suspension."
2521,April 2015,laurasdada,"The standard seats in the XF are pretty good.  While not ""Sport"" seats, I feel they lean in that direction with decent bolstering on the sides and the seat itself.  The ""Bonded"" leather can be a bit slippery, but I stay pretty much in place when the road curves.  I really wish the seat bottom had thigh support/adjustments though.  I find the cushion just a hair short and I'd prefer more support/adjustment.  The XK had the multiple adjustable seats, everything was adjustable.  Fabulous.  I would have had to have sprung for the $4k Portfolio pkg. in the XF to get those seats, the only option my XF does not have."
2522,April 2015,andres3,Buick's reputation for being more reliable than other GM cars may have been severely tarnished by someone actually letting the RPM gauge go past 3K or pushing the throttle past 33%.
2523,April 2015,andres3,"I'd for certain argue about safety, as if I'm killed in a Kia Rio rental I'd of likely survived in an Audi S4."
2524,April 2015,andres3,assuming the Dodge doesn't break down before the weekend's out......
2525,April 2015,roadburner,"You need to get over your ""I got screwed by a Neon"" complex..."
2526,April 2015,Michaell,...by putting him into a Hellcat or an SRT 392 for the weekend.
2527,April 2015,nyccarguy,"Every single manufacturer has gone through significant changes (for better or worse) since the mid-90's when you owned your Neon.  In fact, if things hadn't changed I'd be right there with you.  My first car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT (bought brand new) which had a myriad of problems that concluded with the loeb of the camshaft (2nd from the top) completely wearing down at 61K miles.  For years I swore off GM and Domestics in general.  I'm sure I even vowed at one point (most likely on these boards) to never set foot in a D3 dealership again.  Durability and reliability have increased tremendously across the board.  Horsepower numbers are up (and so is weight).  Significant weight loss seems to be the next trend.  Each manufacturer does make a performance oriented car that given proper modifications will perform very well at the track.  There are very few cars out there that are ""no compromise."""
2528,April 2015,robr2,The part that bugs me the most is that it wasn't even his car.  It was his parents'.  I figure his grandkids will be the ones to give up the grudge.
2529,April 2015,tlong,"I would rather buy a Mazda 3, fully loaded, for under $30K and have better reliability and a good seat at a reasonable price."
2530,April 2015,roadburner,I'll just pour more fuel on the fire; my wife liked the seats in the Fiat 500 Pop we rented better than the E90's seats. Ditto for the chairs in my 1999 Wrangler Sahara.
2531,April 2015,graphicguy,"Heck...if I can get over my Cadillac aversion, anyone can get over whatever prejudice with any car model/company."
2532,April 2015,markcincinnati,"Seat update: there is an Audi A6 (not S6, A6) seat option that does, mostly, mitigate my complaints about the flat, slick bucket seats that are standard equipment."
2533,April 2015,cdnpinhead,Now
2534,April 2015,cdnpinhead,
2535,April 2015,tlong,I really like that edition of the TSX - in many ways better than my same vintage TL.
2536,April 2015,andres3,"Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 ("
2537,April 2015,andres3,"It's not just the Neon that was a bad model, take a look at Calibers, PT Cruisers, Darts (problems in Edmunds' own long term tester) Stratus', Cirrus', Pacifica's, and more."
2538,April 2015,andres3,"First of all, it was a shared car; meaning it wasn't just my Parents'.  It was shared ownership.  Second of all, have things more than name changes really changed?  Neon = PT Cruiser = Caliber = Dart.   Yes, lots of name changes, but have the head gaskets and AC compressors improved?  Yes, they have more than 3 automatic gears now, but has reliability increased?   They still sit at the bottom of any credible source on reliability."
2539,April 2015,andres3,"The jury is still out with your Cadillac though.  Let's see if your aversion returns by the time you get to say.... 65,000 miles.    Again, Edmunds' long term testers just a few years ago from Cadillac had parts flying/falling off, rattling, coming apart, and generally unacceptable problems."
2540,April 2015,andres3,I think the Neon experience was so bad that I have no patience left in this lifetime for an unreliable car.  Another unreliable car would quickly vanish from my possession.  I am risk averse to unreliable possibilities.
2541,April 2015,andres3,"I would add more refined sport suspension, possibly better summer tires (not sure on that one; check to see if they are the same size tire too), more quality control which leads to far better reliability, durability, less warranty hassles, far improved interior, improved materials AND fit & finish/build quality, longer warranty? free loaners if you need a warranty trip, more std. equipment (?), better seats, improved looks (subjective), more color selection, more option choices, and different trim level configurations whereas the GLI is pretty much you get what you get."
2542,April 2015,andres3,"I notice the benefits of AWD every time I stomp on it from a traffic light, or stomp on it making a 90 degree turn from a stop which would cause over steer in RWD and excessive wheel spin in FWD.  I especially notice the same things when it's raining or the pavement is wet."
2543,April 2015,graphicguy,"I think that's why I'm anti-Audi right now.  If they wouldn't have acted like posteriors, stepped up and taken care of the problems that they admitted to having, instead of jerking me around, they'd be on my shopping list."
2544,April 2015,flightnurse,"Mark, BMW allows people to add options that are not normally available on US cars, but this has to get the blessing of BMWNA, example, if you order a 328i Luxury Line, you can get the sport seats for $500. Infact many CA are not aware of this, I just found out that Tanszanite Blue  Metallic ( an M car color) can be had on any BMW, for $1950, Rick and I both really like the color, I would assume if we got that color on the 328i GT it would be the only one in the US. What I was getting at, was, contact Audi NA and see if getting sport seats are allowed and if Audi will give you the blessing on this option. Doesn't hurt to ask."
2545,April 2015,flightnurse,"I'll take it even further, the Sport seats on the F30 cars are wider and the bolsters aren't as big as on the E90 cars or E46 cars. I think people need to remember is, not everybody tracks their cars, so sport seats aren't needed. Dino, how many times as your wagon seen the track or driven to the point in which those Sport Seats where really needed?"
2546,April 2015,dino001,You obviously never sat in them.  Track has nothing to do with it.  Good bolstering and correct profile are useful everywhere. I'm not talking about some supersporty Recaros - just decent bottom cushion with extended thigh support (which is probably my most favorite thing about this particular seat) and well-profiled back cushions keeping you in place as you turn the car on signals at any speeds with the back profile having adjustable lumbar support that doesn't kill your back after 200 miles.
2547,March 2015,robr2,"They'll get over it.  IMHO, the Flying Spur has some resemblance to a late 90's A8.  The Continental has some last gen 9-5 in the rear as well."
2548,March 2015,carnaught,
2549,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Regarding American cars recapturing the luxury end of the market, I think any new names will have to make sure that affluent 40-50 year olds take notice.  ""Continental"" fortunately shares an alliance with Bentley heritage."
2550,March 2015,markcincinnati,I have to assume that the reason these players (and many others) offer AWD options for their F and R drive models is first and foremost a marketing/market penetration decision.
2551,April 2015,flightnurse,"I agree with this, the problem I saw with the Caddy wagon was the interior room was on the small side, rear leg room was horrible... I still like the MB wagon, has a nice look to it but then it only comes in AWD.."
2552,April 2015,flightnurse,"Let's get the name correct, Ford for some stupid reason is calling it a Lincoln Continental, personally I think the Lincoln name needs to be dropped, make the new Continental something you want as aspire to own.."
2553,April 2015,flightnurse,Just as people became over confidence with ABS stopping their car faster...
2554,April 2015,tlong,"""It's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior"
2555,April 2015,robr2,"I respectfully disagree.  It makes no sense for Ford to create a new ""brand.""  The cost would be prohibitive."
2556,April 2015,sda,"Perhaps we'll see names like Capri, Mark, Town Car come back?  Versailles, probably not.  I do miss the days when most car names were not some combination of letters, numbers.  There were some great names like Wildcat, Galaxie, DeVille, Starfire, Skylark, Imperial, Fury, etc."
2557,April 2015,graphicguy,"Continental has a storied name.  Did a little research last night on the Continental (which is a moniker that Bentley also uses).  At different times, the Continental was indeed a separate Ford brand.  Mostly though, it was a model of Lincoln (usually the top Lincoln model)."
2558,April 2015,graphicguy,Mark...I never would have pegged you as a fan of teen pop songs......(j/k).
2559,April 2015,Mr_Shiftright,I read somewhere that Ford was thinking of starting prices in the $75K range for the Continental.
2560,April 2015,flightnurse,"Continental is not a new Brand for Ford, look at Fords history and you will see it."
2561,April 2015,flightnurse,"Having owned a true Continental, they were cars in which people aspired to own, It wasn't until the mid 60's in which Lincoln and Continental shared the same name. Lincoln has started to turn itself around but to offer a car to start in the 70's it shouldn't have a Lincoln name attached to it."
2562,April 2015,sweendogy,
2563,April 2015,markcincinnati,"I did say sarcasm was difficult to convey in these posts -- stick shifts are unloved because the MARKET has determined the automatics, NOT the stick shifts are superior.  This, however is not said with sarcasm."
2564,April 2015,markcincinnati,"By the way, for those who poo-poo AWD and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security, why does Porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with AWD?"
2565,April 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"AWD doesn't erode performance-- it actually helps performance, but it's just not related very much to handling and braking--in some cases, detrimental to it.   There are Porsche drivers and Porsche drivers, and each chooses his weapon depending on the battle he wishes to fight.  Something for everybody---that's good marketing."
2566,April 2015,robr2,I am quite aware that Continental was once a distinct brand tate Ford used.  It existed for only two years before being folded into Lincoln in 1957.
2567,April 2015,Mr_Shiftright,Maybe they've got their eyes on a global market for this car. Foreign buyers have no real point of reference regarding the history of the name.
2568,April 2015,robr2,China is a key target market for the Continental and for Lincoln as a brand.
2569,April 2015,andys120,"Count me as one who is happy to see a Lincoln that, whatever other faults it might have, has a real name, not a hodge-podge of initials.  As for the concept car it looks promising, with a Bentley-esque flair to the styling but we'll have to wait and see if the actual car looks good (toning down those silly wheels would be a good start)."
2570,April 2015,Mr_Shiftright,Well they could do like they did with the first Lexus--undercut the competition at first by $10K-$15K and then gradually increase it if the model is popular.
2571,April 2015,markcincinnati,"Someone somewhere once said, ""Life is full of disappointments, get used to it."""
2572,April 2015,tlong,"I recently visited an Audi dealer after many years away and took a look at the cars. I noticed thath the ""standard"" seat was very flat and uninspiring. The ""sport"" seats were highly bolstered and adjustable."
2573,April 2015,roadburner,"The base seats in the newer BMWs are just mediocre, at best. The seats in my wife's E90 are not anywhere near as comfortable as the seats in my MS3- never mind the sport seats in my Club Sport or the E21 Recaros in my '02. My dealer has a CPO 135i stick with every option but the Sport or M Sport package. I'd be sorely tempted were it not for that omission."
2574,April 2015,markcincinnati,"I am so spoiled, and until Saturday I didn't even know it.  The S4's seats (and I have the optional red leather upgraded ones) are both comfortable and grippy.  For years the sport seat option was a stand alone upgrade and, as I recall, was priced at $550.  Even adjusted for inflation and twice the cost, I'd go ahead and pay $1,000-ish for the upgrade -- seems like about $650 would be ""appropriate"" though."
2575,April 2015,circlew,Why would anyone buy a BMW without sport seats?  Only those who haven't indulged!
2576,April 2015,graphicguy,"Mark...I echo your sentiments about the A6 with the 3.0T and sport set up.  I felt that would be my next purchase if things had turned out better with my S4.  Not so, though.  I also agree about the seats....nowhere near what I want.  But, everything is a compromise.  The A6 with the S4 motor is screaming cruiser."
2577,March 2015,qbrozen,"I'm sure you just mistyped, stick, but balance and handling are not dependent on the driven wheels. Better acceleration traction in all conditions? Yes. That's it."
2578,March 2015,stickguy,AWD instead of FWD.  wasn't comparing to RWD here.
2579,March 2015,flightnurse,"I couldn't have said it better, but of course, the buying public and even people in this forum have bought the package that if you live in an area that gets snow, then you must have AWD..."
2580,March 2015,flightnurse,"So now that we are beating a dead horse again,"
2581,March 2015,dino001,"I disagree.  Handling is absolutely affected by driven wheels.  Try to enter a corner at excessive speed, then hit brakes or accelerator at different times and see how the car reacts.  Depending on the propelled wheels, it will do different things."
2582,March 2015,nyccarguy,And the main problem with Audis is that I just keep hearing not so good things about long term reliability & customer service.  From our own
2583,March 2015,roadburner,Don't forget driver100's clutch failure at 10k miles...
2584,March 2015,stickguy,buying a used on does scare me.  Nice cars though.  Most likely it would never be something that would end up being my choice (unless I was leasing possibly).  Though I did find a really nice looking one recently.  It's Purty.
2585,March 2015,nyccarguy,I agree.  They are nice looking.  Well finished & drive great.  But a risk no less.
2586,March 2015,qbrozen,"Well, the old Integra R dominates the old Impreza RS at the autocross."
2587,March 2015,qbrozen,"Sorry, I should have said ""better handling"" is not dependent on driven wheels. Yes, they will handle differently, but not necessarily better."
2588,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"To each his own I guess is the final say. I had the opportunity to drive a RWD vs AWD Porsche back to back and I thought the AWD car pushed a lot in the turns. It's more work. For driving pleasure I would have chosen the RWD.  Snow is not an issue where I live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of AWD in this zip code. The reason I bought a used 4WD truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. I guess some AWD like Subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's Mercedes AWD doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal.  He doesn't seem to care or notice the AWD--it just came that way."
2589,March 2015,Michaell,"When the wife wanted the Subaru Outback, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the SUV's she'd been driving."
2590,March 2015,m6user,"Let me be perfectly clear.  I don't consider AWD  a need but I find it very nice to have many days during the winter and on some rainy days.  It always seems that the people that are so sure it doesn't help get you around more efficiently in the winter are those that live in Florida or Arizona for example.  I have a rwd truck and have had plenty of rear wheel drive cars.  And like I said, equipped the same and driven with common sense the awd will be much easier to get around on slippery, snowpacked roads.  Ground clearance isn't a big deal for me as it is rarely a factor in the Midwest. But slushy or hardpacked snowy roads are very common and awd makes much more secure footing when in traffic and pulling or merging into traffic."
2591,March 2015,robr2,Subaru dropped the wagon for a couple of reasons.  First it wasn't a great seller.  Second was the fact that it's MPG wasn't that great and affected their CAFE number.  The Outback is considered an SUV and it's MPG doesn't count against CAFE.
2592,March 2015,nyccarguy,
2593,March 2015,Michaell,I understand why Subaru dropped the wagon. It doesn't mean I have to be happy with that decision
2594,March 2015,graphicguy,"Cadillac dropped their wagon, too.  It had a lot of good press. Unfortunately, there's still that stigma that goes with wagons."
2595,March 2015,kyfdx,"I always saw it the other way..    the Mercedes wagon people were ""old money"", that just bought a wagon, because they wanted a wagon...     The S-class people were the ""nouveau riche""."
2596,March 2015,robr2,"Me too.  E Class wagons were for those with old, moldy money.  They also had a Grand Wagoneer at the shore house."
2597,March 2015,laurasdada,"I grew up in the era of FWD and ""Hot Hatches.""  My first car was an original VW Scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo.  Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL).  I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time?  Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going.  Of course, ground clearance is another factor..."
2598,March 2015,laurasdada,"Oh, yeah.  And what's cool is that most of the time the XF has a RWD bias, I believe it is 90% of the torque goes to the rear axle.  Pushing the snow button changes it to 30/70 with the computer deciding upon when to make it 50/50."
2599,March 2015,robr2,"So will the new Continental be an ELLPS?  V6, AWD, big 19"" wheels......"
2600,March 2015,stickguy,No EL in that.  And those wheels are hideous.
2601,March 2015,robr2,"Well the definition is all over the place now so if it starts under $40, it's EL."
2602,March 2015,benjaminh,"My guess is the new Continental will be a top of the line model with a starting msrp north of 50k. But, with the likely rebates and discounts you might be able to score a ""base"" model in the low 40s....Guilty pleasure, I guess, but I think it looks pretty good. But kinda wish they'd gone with ""suicide"" doors lol...."
2603,March 2015,stickguy,Absolutely
2604,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, that's right, AWD does not improve handling...it improves acceleration. Which is where I got the idea of ""over confidence"" from---that you might end up going faster than you can safely stop."
2605,March 2015,graphicguy,"Bentley has their panties all up in a bunch over this car.  Lincoln has given it the go ahead, BTW.  Have no idea on pricing.  Supposed to be on a stretched Fusion platform.  So, see this at your LINCOLN dealer sometime in the near future."
2606,March 2015,roadburner,"Big, FWD(or FWD biased AWD), expensive for  what you get- yawn..."
2607,March 2015,qbrozen,"I'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: ENTRY LEVEL is price-dependent. Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words. Base MSRP provides a consistent basis of comparison."
2608,March 2015,flightnurse,"Mark every car magazine has disproved this whole ""If you live in snow country, you need AWD"" Car's today and the electronic nannies have helped so much that AWD isn't really needed, plus these same magazines have shown how people have a false sense of security with these cars."
2609,March 2015,Michaell,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."
2610,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."
2611,March 2015,m6user,"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time."""
2612,March 2015,graphicguy,"All good points.  The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens.  Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent,  Cruise, Fiesta, etc.  Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc.  Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything.  That's how they get to those price points."
2613,March 2015,stickguy,Lots of us open the moonroof all the time.  And many people that don't still open the shade to get more light in.  Especially important in the typical German black cave interior!
2614,March 2015,qbrozen,"Started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" However, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. That's why I've been stressing BASE MSRP. I absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. The only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the M, AMG, S, or V examples."
2615,March 2015,stickguy,"Q nailed it. These are the models to get the budget challenged into the category/brand. Not the highest performance or most luxurious, but with reasonable quantities of both. Size is not that important.  Nor is drivetrain configuration. Badge and price are."
2616,March 2015,stickguy,"My son is a good example.  First job, new car, tight finances. He got a Jetta. SE. Wanted a GLI, but got in fold and hooked on German cars.   Already planning next one. Drools on an S3.  Will probably settle for an A3.  After that, will depend on how his budget (and family if one comes along) grows!  But he does aspire to move up the ladder."
2617,March 2015,Michaell,"Other than AWD and a few extra HP, what's the difference between the GLI and the A3?"
2618,March 2015,m6user,"Nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand.  For a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an Audi versus a Vdub could be a game changer. LOL."
2619,March 2015,roadburner,"Back to AWD, I can understand why you might want one in the mountains or the Northeast; but even in my neck of the woods people spring for AWD.(the reason we have a Jeep and and an X3 truck is because our 1500' gravel driveway rarely sees a plow- but note that my Wrangler made it through over 18"" of snow in 2WD thanks to BFG All Terrain KO tires with the Severe Snow rating)."
2620,March 2015,stickguy,"I was going to say ""4 rings"".  Though in a performance oriented car, the AWD can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate NY).  Something like a GLI where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season."
2621,March 2015,m6user,"Yeah, well since he said ""besides AWD and a few extra HP"" I didn't address the AWD part.  But that would be a large factor in that neck of the woods."
2622,March 2015,robr2,Perhaps the young man should reevaluate his date if that's what the measure she uses....
2623,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,Any AWD system can be completed neutralized by the wrong tires and the wrong driver.
2624,March 2015,nyccarguy,"So many times I hear someone say:  ""my car stinks in the snow or my car drives terribly in the snow.""  For the longest time I responded with:  ""its probably not your car that drives terribly in the snow, if equipped with a proper set of winter tires you should have no problems.""  That usually got the ""deer in the headlights stare"" at which point I would just say:  ""You are right.  you need AWD or 4WD."""
2625,March 2015,roadburner,"Yep- the ""wearers."""
2626,March 2015,m6user,"If given the choice of driving the same exact vehicle with the same exact tires in a winter snowstorm, I would choose the AWD vehicle every time.  People always say ""well if you used the right tires and drove like me you would have no issues"".   Actually getting tired of hearing that.  And there is a big difference between ""need"" and ""nice to have"".  Do I need AWD in the winter around Chicago?.....not really.  Is it very nice to have in certain situations where you need you need to get out of someone else's way or get going from a light in slippery conditions?  Yes, it is very nice to have.   Of course, I can get around without AWD as I occasionally drive my RWD v-8 truck in the snow but it isn't a lot of fun."
2627,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps. If you doubt this, I invite you to talk to any tow truck driver who operates in or near a popular ski area. If nothing else, and it doesn't convince you, you'll get some entertaining stories."
2628,March 2015,nyccarguy,"I have got to tell you, the more I think about it, the more I like the Audi S3 Premium Plus.  Look at the standard features you get:"
2629,March 2015,Michaell,"Only if the lady in question is a snob .. she might prefer the VW due to the IQ of the owner, understanding the value..."
2630,March 2015,Michaell,And I'd rather get a Golf R - all of the above (I think) and the practicality of a hatch!
2631,March 2015,m6user,"""Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps."""
2632,March 2015,m6user,That does seem to be a nice price for the S3.  Is that price good for all that equip??
2633,March 2015,stickguy,"Bradd, from reading about the ride on that, you might not enjoy it on the I95 bomb craters very much."
2634,March 2015,stickguy,"AWD is not just snow.  Vs. FWD, it can also give better handling and balance on wet roads. And dry.  The WRX is AWD for a reason!"
2635,March 2015,roadburner,You nailed it!
2636,March 2015,robr2,Because it's a Subaru and the purists would have a conniption if it were anything else!!
2637,March 2015,graphicguy,I go away for awhile and look what happens....we're debating the definition of an acronym.  LOL!
2638,March 2015,robr2,Well let's go back to my list and note the sizes based on EPA standards:
2639,March 2015,cdnpinhead,Some more than others.
2640,March 2015,m6user,"I don't pay any attention to what category the EPA puts a car in.  Heck, they classify the Bentley 12 cyl as a compact car.  Don't think too many people look at one of those and say ""boy, that's a sharp compact car""."
2641,March 2015,qbrozen,"Actually, the ILX/A3/CLA/1-series are subcompacts. Then you have your compacts (A4, C-class, 3-series, ATS), your midsize (5-series, etc), and your full-size (7-series, etc). There is the microcar class below all of that, but the luxo players haven't ventured there yet."
2642,March 2015,breld,I like the above take from
2643,March 2015,robr2,Except that the ILX and CLA are both considered compacts by the EPA.  So are we now going to identify by barely a compact and almost a mid-size?
2644,March 2015,qbrozen,"They are? Huh. Where do I look that info up? Because I tried fueleconomy.gov and they list the Aston Rapide S as subcompact, so methinks that's not a reliable source."
2645,March 2015,robr2,Well the EPA is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source.  Here is the link:
2646,March 2015,m6user,"I really don't know anyone, myself included, that consults with or cares what class the EPA designates a car.    Manufacturers seldom market their cars using the EPA categories."
2647,March 2015,robr2,I'm sure that not consulting the EPA class is true for the vast majority of car shoppers.  But it is something that is common across all vehicles that can be measured.  The fuel economy listed on the Munroney sticker uses it as a guide.
2648,March 2015,qbrozen,"Agree, now that I know how its done, EPA classes are useless."
2649,March 2015,m6user,"""You will often hear the phrase ""Best whatever in it's class."" That typically refers to the EPA category."""
2650,March 2015,tlong,"Let's not forget that size impressions change over time. The Accord was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. The current Civic is larger than earlier Accords. And so Honda has introduced the Fit, which is larger than the first Civics. You can use the same analogy for the Corolla and then Yaris, or the A4 and then the A3, or the C-class and now the CLA."
2651,March 2015,m6user,It seems like the luxury makers have new entry level cars that are not up to the same level of luxury nor performance of the cars that preceded them.  So an argument could be made that they are not ELLPS because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand.   I wasn't impressed with either the CLA or the ILX at the auto show from a luxury viewpoint.
2652,March 2015,markcincinnati,"My head hurts less, now that we can go back to what I presume was actually intended from the get go:"
2653,March 2015,sweendogy,I agree with goldie-
2654,March 2015,markcincinnati,Coming Soon
2655,March 2015,graphicguy,"This was a few years ago, but I was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new Mustang GT.  Not a slow car by any stretch.  Until, I got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an F150 in the next lane."
2656,March 2015,roadburner,"Agreed; that's what I like about my MS3 it's relatively quick(especially since I boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable cruiser. I also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. Right now I'm trying to decide my next car will be a focused track toy or a more luxurious Grand Tourer. In either case it will almost certainly be a RWD coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
2657,March 2015,flightnurse,"I think people are missing the point on price, the prices people are quoting is MSRP, who pays MSRP?  So a 320i with premium package, Leather, Sport Package and Lighting Package $41,400. Can be had easily for $38,400 and right now BMW has $1,500 debate on cars on the dealers lot, $36,900. I'm sure you can get said 320i for even less then this. So for under$40K you can have a ELPS this is with  manual transmission... Lease Payments for said BMW with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. Now a 328i with Sport package, Premium package (includes Leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (MSRP) Could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate BMW has, and I'm sure you could get this price down even more.. With mim down, lease payments would be roughly $375/m"
2658,March 2015,m6user,Nobody is missing the point.  Everyone realizes what you're saying but some deals are better than others for a variety of reasons.  That's why people use MSRP for reference.  It's like using the EPA MPG numbers.  Everyone knows that peoples mpg varies some but for comparison purposes the EPA numbers are best to use.  There is always somebody that got $10k off or pays close to MSRP for some oddball reason or gets 40mpg in a car rated for 32.  Better to deal with verifiable numbers for comparison sake.
2659,March 2015,qbrozen,exactly. And deals vary throughout the year. MSRP is the only way that makes consistent sense.
2660,March 2015,markcincinnati,"QB: wouldn't that mean that the Audi S4 (not RS) and the BMW 335 (not M) would be ineligible?  I know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain parameters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria."
2661,March 2015,sweendogy,"I like the idea of a bmw that's sporty for under 40k....but el cheapo with auto (which some herd have ) is not it. Talk about sport all you want- and I like the MS3 becaus in many ways it's a better car then the 320. The Manual 320 (never driven) Prob a nice rig,328 manual even better I guess.  Talk lease leader ad deals- guys who get 10-15k of cts - but real world when you need a car you take msrp and subtract an amount- usually 10-% or less depending on car. I love cars- I love cars with passion more. Do you feel the love (tonight?)"
2662,March 2015,graphicguy,"BMW is all about the lease payment.  I was not a typical customer for them, since I don't lease.  When I bought my first one, a fair amount of time ago, my sales guy was a little taken aback by me negotiating based on a purchase.  He said they always negotiated payment.  He's a good guy.  Whenever I walk into the dealership, he knows I'm seriously looking and not just kicking tires.  We go straight to the ""dealer sheet"", allegedly with his cost and MSRP on it."
2663,March 2015,qbrozen,"I could be talked into $45k, which allows the 335i, but not the 335ix. I could go either way, frankly. I think $40k would make more sense after BMW releases a smaller class here in the US to compete with the CLA/A3"
2664,March 2015,markcincinnati,"What is the issue with the base price?  The class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about.  The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact.  If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's.  These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller.  In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series."
2665,March 2015,nyccarguy,I think the 320i is going to be a tremendous value once they start coming off lease ans selling as CPO BMWs for the low to mid $20K.
2666,March 2015,dino001,"Mark, I think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here.  You seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker.  They said so repeatedly.  It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford.  For myself, I don't look at cars at their base.  If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me.  I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it.  But that vantage point difference is very real.  I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. S4 used to be IMHO above 335, but that was before they eliminated V6 version of A4 and S4 took its place, giving space to RS4/5.  I totally disagree on M or RS.  There is absolutely NOTHING entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering.  ZERO. Other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. Small size?  Porsches are even smaller, so what?  That's not enough."
2667,March 2015,roadburner,"I can't remember the words ""performance"" and ""Lincoln"" being used in the same sentence since the demise of the Mark VII LSC in the early '90s."
2668,March 2015,rayainsw,'.. since the demise of the Mark VII LSC in the early '90s.'
2669,March 2015,roadburner,Good catch- that would DEFINITELY be an ELLPS- it slipped what's left of my mind...
2670,March 2015,robr2,The ILX doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.
2671,March 2015,robr2,"IMHO, it doesn't meet the criteria of being able to corner without inducing intestinal distress or the puckering of one's sphincter."
2672,March 2015,dino001,"I think, I agree.  Never heard of anybody trying to toss it into a corner.  Mr. McConaughey is shown strolling down the boulevard at quite pedestrian pace, so the intended use is quite clear.  It's not wrong, but it's not sports, or performance, even withh 300 horses."
2673,March 2015,dino001,"I think ATS, bigger size and increased pricing did that already."
2674,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Is the common thought that, for example, the A3 is an ELLPS but the A4 is not?"
2675,March 2015,robr2,Of course - brain fart there.  I meant the ATS will be pushed out by a subcompact Cadillac.  I edited my post to reflect that.
2676,March 2015,sweendogy,"Ah the Lincoln LS ... ""I drove Lincolns before anyone paid me to drive lincolns"" now I finally understand whats Specolis best friend ways saying.  The Lincoln should be added - it's sudo lux, looks pretty cool and is under 40k- no idea how it drives but seems similar to the others -and if you add a Buick then this should be fair game."
2677,March 2015,m6user,I haven't driven a Lincoln MKZ but I understand it is has similar underpinnings to the Fusion which is based on the Euro Mondeo.  Reviews of the Fusion usually put it near the top in handling for mainstream midsize cars.
2678,March 2015,robr2,OK - updated list:
2679,March 2015,tlong,"So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much."
2680,March 2015,robr2,Just for grins and giggles what are the prices if you tick every options box?
2681,March 2015,tlong,OK - ticking all the boxes of what looked to be factory/port options - no dealer accessories AFAIK.
2682,March 2015,dino001,"How about C-class?  Too big now, or too expensive? A4? I see, there are lower models, so they no longer need to apply.  I think it is possible to have two models in same category, if they're not differentiated ad much.  It does look like C-class is intended to move up, just as CTS.  I think A4 is still in the class, both in size and price."
2683,March 2015,dino001,"I think there is a difference between sportyish mainstream sedan, like Fusion or its plush cousin (more like stepbrother) and 328, A4, or TLX.  They may not be world apart, but the separation is distinct."
2684,March 2015,benjaminh,"The Acura ILX is about 6 inches longer than the Audi A3, and gets to 60 faster than the A3 1.8. At a little after 14 minutes in this long video Alex on Autos measures the acceleration of the ILX at 6.25 0-60, which seems to be about half a second faster than the A3 1.8. At 12:20 he talks about how Acura's 8-speed dual clutch is in some ways superior to that offered in the Audi A3. The Audi obviously has a lot more prestige, and arguably a nicer interior, but the Acura has more standard equipment—like moonroof, heated power seat, rearview camera, pushbutton start, LED headlights, etc. The A3 does have standard leather, while the base ILX has pleather. The A3 also has a better standard stereo. Overall, a comparably equipped A3 1.8 costs maybe about $4-5k more than an ILX, and yet the A3 is slower and gets lower mpg. I may be the only one, but I think if you're including the A3 1.8 then there's a case to be made for the ILX. But if you're starting with the A3 2.0 quattro, I guess that's a different story...."
2685,March 2015,robr2,"Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB."
2686,March 2015,ab348,The ILX also suffers from the stigma of being perceived by many as a tarted-up Civic. Even though the competing models are also built on existing mainstream platforms. the ILX tends to suffer from that more than most.
2687,March 2015,qbrozen,"ILX is still part of a luxo brand, so I say it counts regardless of driven wheels. I mean, put it this way... So a FWD A4 is not luxo, but an AWD version that is optioned exactly the same other than the driven wheels is now luxo? Doesn't make sense to me. They will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about."
2688,March 2015,venture,Sort of.
2689,March 2015,robr2,"The Mondeo was delayed by 3 years to allow Ford to focus on ""balancing the supply and demand of its industrial footprint.""  Which means they needed time to consolidate their European factories to stop the flow of red ink."
2690,March 2015,ab348,"It's not that it's BUILT on a shared platform - as I said, most are. It's how it is perceived compared to other makes. Perhaps it's because Honda Canada commissioned a few generations of particularly awful Acura variations of the Civic that were little more than a different grille and some extra trim. Up here they are known as the Acura Civic regardless of how they're badged."
2691,March 2015,benjaminh,"It's true that the A3 looks nothing at all like the Golf, while as much as the ILX is restyled and upgraded from the Civic, it has more trouble escaping its sibling. More than that, Audi seems to signify ""premium"" and ""prestige,"" even if a base A3 1.8 falls behind an ILX on some things while costing thousands more...."
2692,March 2015,kyfdx,"I say the ILX counts, as well..      (though, I wouldn't choose it..)."
2693,March 2015,stickguy,The Ilx counts IMO for 2016 with the bigger engine and new trans. Plenty quick enough for the class.
2694,March 2015,benjaminh,"The ""directional"" wheels on the ILX seem a little odd to me, and maybe out of place for an aspiring ELLS. I don't dislike them, exactly, but they wouldn't be my first choice. I think they're supposed to appeal to younger buyers, but for those of us old enough to remember the 80s, they seem almost nostalgic. And I wonder if the car would sell better if they just called it the Integra. In my mind, that's what I imagine the I in ILX stands for anyway...."
2695,March 2015,markcincinnati,"I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming).  This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS."
2696,March 2015,stickguy,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level.   still within the EL family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors."
2697,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Perhaps these cars that we talk about that are in this broad broad category should be called Compact LPS, but also it might make sense to call them mid-size? Entry level and the LP designation if price is the current meaning of EL would seem to be an oxymoron -- and, if price is the meaning of EL, today, where do A3's, to name one, go?  Do we ""rationalize"" the naming according to price? The Audi lineup (to name the one I am most familiar with) is A3 (and Q3), A4/A5 (and Q5), A6/A7 (and Q7).  The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate.  But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size."
2698,March 2015,roadburner,I know of at least one Bavaria with an S38 motor from an E28 M5 under the hood...
2699,March 2015,graphicguy,"OK...if we're setting rules...$45K MSRP upper limit? Acura,Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lincoln, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo are the brands?"
2700,March 2015,nyccarguy,"I agree that entry level definitely has to meet a price point.  Problem is that there is way too much over lapping within the respective companies.  The ""entry level"" price points vary as well.  Yes there is a big difference between the meat of this market of $35K - $50K on paper.  You have to factor in the fact that the majority of these cars are leased.  So many times people don't see the difference of a few thousand dollars by looking at the total cost of the lease , but rather as an extra $30, $40, $50 etc per month."
2701,March 2015,stickguy,"Bradd, definitely include the Volvo S60 too."
2702,March 2015,nyccarguy,Done
2703,March 2015,breld,So Bradd - only the upper model of the TLX makes the cut?  Just curious.
2704,March 2015,nyccarguy,Just my suggestions of course.  I feel like Acura's big V6 & slick AWD system do transform the car into a true competitor in the segment.
2705,March 2015,qbrozen,"I used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I'm thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6."
2706,March 2015,markcincinnati,"If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely  assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base)."
2707,March 2015,dino001,"You forgot about 320i, Mark - even more ""pauper"" version, but according to some here, still spunky enough for their taste.  I don't think less than 200 hp is such a problem, if the car is still dynamic enough, so I'd add it.  In fact, I'd say that one would be something like ""entry level of entry level"""
2708,March 2015,qbrozen,"Eh, I really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you said in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. I could argue either way, honestly."
2709,March 2015,breld,Makes sense - particularly to the extent AWD or RWD is considered a requirement for the segment.
2710,March 2015,breld,"As for the criteria for what belongs in this segment (and the fact that there is no hard and fast answer is what makes this a fun discussion), how about the manufacturers' intention?"
2711,March 2015,markcincinnati,I stand corrected ANY 3XX denomination or derivative that keeps the L+P (and the 320 qualifies) does belong.
2712,March 2015,qbrozen,"Once again, an M3 is not entry-level by any stretch of the imagination. Nobody is spending $60k thinking ""yeah, this is entry-level."""
2713,March 2015,dino001,"It will be $50K soon.  335i has now starting price of just squeaking below $45K cap, guess what it will be next year.  435 is already above $45K, both coupe and grand coupe. So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation.  Also C400 is already above $45K."
2714,March 2015,nyccarguy,"""$69,999"""
2715,March 2015,dino001,"I agree.  I think it's again in eye of the beholder.  Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances.  Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means.  Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture.  I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class.  If people buy it, so be it."

2717,March 2015,Michaell,"rob, i think your logic makes perfect sense and endorse your list of vehicles completely."

2729,March 2015,dino001,"And it always is the same - majority of voices have ""fantasy land"" assumptions, from wrong pricing to features, mostly due to lack of recognition in market changes.  So from one side saying that $70K+ M3 is an ""Entry Level"" , to another being completely in denial on how much prices rose in last 20 years ($40K ""all in"" won't even buy you sport suspension on some of those ""performance sedans""). Then somebody else says A3 is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition.  Classic eat the cake and have it, too."

So, I meant to say G35 in its first and second generation were closest to ELLPS in their nature in last 10-15 years.  BTW, I new about the rebadging to Q40, but formally G37 it is no longer with us."

2740,March 2015,laurasdada,"Tough to define this sector, definition could be quite broad.  I imagine one would have to parse each manufacturer to determine which model is their ""entry level.""  And, then is it luxury and performance DNA?  For example, in my distant outpost in the universe known as ""Jaguar,"" I drive the current entry level Jag, the XF.  Is it entry level by definition here?  Well, if E, 5, and A6 variants are, then yes.  IMHO, it certainly has luxury and performance, but is never mentioned here.  And, a few years ago, would a BMW 3 really be ""luxury?""  Mercedes Benz was luxury, BMW covered performance and perhaps Audi was the only marque that could be included here, combining luxury and sport."
2741,March 2015,stickguy,"Well, 10 years ago it was probably the 328i and g35 as the definitive examples.  So extrapolate that and see what you get!"
2742,March 2015,dino001,"""Entry Level Luxury"" in this forum and others usually implied not in a lineup of the maker, but versus wallets of the potential buyers.  Those ""ELL"" basically meant ""premium brand plus some, but not all latest premium features"".   Something, midlevel professional with decent job could afford, as long as they didn't buy too big house, or didn't have too many other obligations.  They also limited the size of the vehicle.  The old X-type from Jag was in that category, but they withdrew from that market completely and now cater to what I would call ""full premium to upscale"" segment with a performance skew into it.  Those sometimes were called LPS, or ""Luxury Performance Sedans""."
2743,March 2015,dino001,"So the question remains - did the segment move with the car models, or did the segment stayed where it is, and the models ""moved out"" of it.  The former means ELLPS is now $45-$60K on the sticker, bigger in size, softer, less raw, more luxury.  The latter means the ""founders"" don't qualify today by either being too expensive, too big, too soft, or all of the above.  I'm sure there will be plenty of arguments both ways."
2744,March 2015,qbrozen,"personally, I would say its an ""either/or"" kind of statement. Its the least expensive sedan on a luxo makers shelf AS LONG AS the base price doesn't exceed $40k. I'm just throwing a number out there for starters, but the idea is that, for example, Jag's XF was previously their lowest car, and with a starting point of $50k, it doesn't qualify as ""entry level."""
2745,March 2015,roadburner,Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.
2746,March 2015,m6user,"I've always considered ELLPS to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook.  How could anyone possibly define that?"
2747,March 2015,markcincinnati,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit.  If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more."
2748,March 2015,qbrozen,"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any variants. An m3 does not belong here, IMHO. It is far from ""entry level."" So, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. And by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the CLA AMG and S3."
2749,March 2015,stickguy,"Dino, I think that as some of the old time models ""grew up"" (outgrew the segment?) the smaller models came in underneath to replace them.  Pretty sure that an A3 is roughly the size (and mission) of the A4 from a couple of generations ago.  And would not be surprised if the ILX is close to the original TSX.  BMW though has not (as far as I recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door."
2750,March 2015,dino001,"Oh yes, they did.  Quite a bit.  Current 3-series is much bigger than mine, which in turn was much bigger then previous one.  15 years ago the 5-series was EPA classified as ""compact"".  Today, it would be hard to classify the 3 series as such."
2751,March 2015,stickguy,"Good to know.  I knew it did creep up, but did not realize it was that much."
2752,March 2015,markcincinnati,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003).  It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series."
2753,March 2015,qbrozen,"I wholeheartedly disagree. An entry-level job is salary-dependent, as is an entry-level house. Why should an entry-level vehicle not follow suit? If the grouping were dependent on size, the title would use car size classification and it would be called ""Compact Luxury Performance Sedans."""
2754,March 2015,stickguy,"I am with Q on this.  To me, the EL is absolutely cost-dependent."
2755,March 2015,rayainsw,'My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0' - roadburner.
2756,March 2015,dino001,"I second that.  Entry level has a money-related conotation in every single product, job, title, service I know.  The only exception I can think of would be in hobby or leisure activity, where it would mean novice, or begginer.  In vehicles, M3  or S4 is not entry level in anything. It is compact, or not large, but certainly not entry level.  Perhaps in some rich exclusive country club, it could, when they would need somebody else vouch for me in my lowly 328, but a M3 owner may be let in without an usher escort watching the silverware..."

2758,March 2015,roadburner,Precisely.
2759,March 2015,roadburner,I'd take a Charger R/T with the Road and Track package over an F10 every time.
2760,March 2015,roadburner,"Can you say ""flash counter?"" To paraphrase a post on an E90 board, You can quote Magnuson-Moss all you want, but if  the turbos start whining or the HPFP acts strange BMW will claim that increasing the power over stock was the cause of the failure. They have lawyers and professionals on retainer to support their position."

So probably for the same price as a loaded Legacy 3.6R limited I could buy an X1.  For the price of most 320xi sedans sitting on dealer lots, I could factory order an X1 35i with minimal options and really have some fun on my commute:)"

2766,March 2015,flightnurse,Your payments would be the same if you got the X1.
2767,March 2015,roadburner,Please explain how anything I wrote would not apply to an F30.
2768,March 2015,nyccarguy,"HA!  You are 100% right my friend!  Between the lease question board, the Incentives & Rebates menu under the Car research tab this is a very dangerous place for me to be hanging out!  I also qualify for USAA rebates now too so that adds fuel to the fire.  As long as I stay away from the dealership, then I'm OK."
2769,March 2015,nyccarguy,"You are probably right.  I drive a little more than 20K per year.  Once you start figuring out leases with that kind of mileage, they start to not look so cheap anymore.  I'm not completely opposed to leasing either given the right circumstances.  I know my wife for instance DOES NOT like driving her Pilot.  She does maybe 12K per year.  I'm sure once her truck is paid for in a few years and the principle is paid down on my Legacy, she's going to want something.  So I could always lease her something nice (like an E-Class, BMW 5er, or Lexus GS) and then buy it out for myself once the Legacy starts to get up there in mileage."
2770,March 2015,breld,"Aaah!   With such a slow couple days on the Chronic Car Buyers forum, I found everyone was over here!  I used to frequent this forum ages ago, but just haven't found my way over here for awhile."
2771,March 2015,qbrozen,"Well, that's cool. I'd get it in writing, though. It is one thing to have a factory-authorized tune installed by the dealer, and another to do it yourself at home, regardless of the programming parameters. Upping the boost is but a portion of the big picture."
2772,March 2015,qbrozen,"He told me there are at least 3 levels of information stored in the car's computer. The first level that you can basically read through the car's OBC, the second that requires the dealer's proprietary equipment, and a 3rd that only regional reps can access. Even with what they could read, the car had been logging all instances of boost going beyond stock limits. He was pretty sure the regional rep could get much more detailed info than that."
2773,March 2015,roadburner,"Back when Erik Wensberg was BMW M Brand Manager he told me a story about a 5 speed E36 M3 that had been flat bedded into a dealership. The owner-whose previous car was an Oldsmobile-said he was simply ""driving down the interstate at 65 mph when the car just died"". Unfortunately for the owner(and his wallet), the DME was interrogated and it revealed a final engine speed in excess of 9000 rpm."
2774,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Could I ask the question: what (now, today) is an ELLPS?"
2775,March 2015,m6user,"Buick Regal GS and Lincoln MKZ?  Buick is more a premium brand as it stands below Cadillac but Lincoln is surely recognized as the luxury division of FoMoCo.  Dodge is certainly not a luxury brand but Chrysler could be considered, like Buick, a premium brand but wouldn't be considered a luxury brand.  Just because a car has a bunch of electronic bells and whistles and stitching on cheap leather doesn't make it a luxury brand.  Many cars are luxurious to a degree but it doesn't make the brand a luxury brand.  Most people don't perceive Hyundai and Kia to be equal to Chevy or Ford let alone be considered a luxury brand.  Granted, they may be equal to Chevy and Ford at this point but the majority perception IMO doesn't put them there.  Perception is reality in the world we live in."
2776,March 2015,graphicguy,There's a confluence of car brands that are starting to blur the lines of ELLS.
2777,March 2015,roadburner,Agree 100%.
2778,March 2015,sweendogy,"If the ELPps is supposed to be entry level you can exclude most mentioned above. The said above companies are using lower letters /numbers for a reason. A3,ats, ILX- sure others I think need to be adjusted - price should matter along with what the manufacturer is telling you."
2779,March 2015,markcincinnati,"One response: concerning the IS but not the ES.  The P in ELLPS (and LPS) stands for? Performance.  There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole.""  The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me."
2780,March 2015,stickguy,"I still can't grasp a $50K car (or more) qualifying for the EL piece (entry level).  Which is why an S4 to me is not in the class.  An A3 (or A4) could be.  a 320i, yes, a loaded 335?  no."
2781,March 2015,flightnurse,"This is why the definition of what a ELLPS really is, each one of us has out own criteria, we have beat this topic to death... But I do think there is a blurring line between ELLS and ELLPS at times."
2782,March 2015,sweendogy,"I agree the 335 could not be included becSue it's not entry level  same with s4.. Ie cheaper . The ""el cheapo"" (not my term), a3, buicks whatever, ilx, maybe the 328 and lower a4, the infini g37, Volvo s (or whatever it's called, weird dash)  - I think price has to be included. The Lexus IS ""el cheapo"" 250 should only be included if you want a passionless car. Performance and Price right- ???"
2783,March 2015,graphicguy,"OK...if we're setting rules...$45K MSRP upper limit?  Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lincoln, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo are the brands?"

2793,March 2015,flightnurse,"Hertz rents the Hertz Mustang GT as well as C7 or the Camero SS, I know they have them at the airport location, so if you really want a fun for that weekend, I would have taken one of them. I know when I flew into San Diego, I was always temped to just one for the few days I was going to be in town."
2794,March 2015,tlong,So what you are saying is that the Camaro (at least that model) isn't really a sports car but a poser car. I concur.
2795,March 2015,tlong,"I recently rented a BMW 328, admittedly a low end model, and I was very unimpressed by the steering feel. Frankly (and seriously), our 2007 Mazda 5 microvan has much better steering feel than that BMW did."
2796,March 2015,benjaminh,"The BMW 320i has 180 hp, while the 328i has 240 hp. I wondered what differences in the engine could account for that 60hp, but according to this article probably the biggest difference between the two models is in the engine software:"
2797,March 2015,dino001,Now that's funny
2798,March 2015,graphicguy,"When I test drove the IS350 F sport, I've mentioned that I liked it quite a bit.  But, like my previous TL, you have to spur it a bit into the upper revs to get any torque."

2800,March 2015,benjaminh,"As we all know, Hyundai not surprisingly has had some trouble selling its luxury models. An extreme example is found at my local dealer, which still has one last 2013 (!) Genesis, which I think is a demo. Not surprisingly, they are offering a huge discount on it of almost $11,000. They are also offering $8k off msrp on some 2014s. The 2013 is a fully loaded Genesis 5.0 V-8 ""R-spec"" model with all the options, and it can be yours for just $37k. I guess it's lot of car for the money....(maybe too much?):"

2803,March 2015,andres3,"Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day.  That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you.  Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day.  I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track.  I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track.  I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track.  Although I did recently have all the necessary fluids (oil, brake, trans, differential) fluid along with new front pads and rotors changed on my wife's 2011 Pilot.  Maybe I should bring it up to LR and see what it can do:)"
2804,March 2015,dino001,"It's not as simple.  Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it.  The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere.  Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract?  I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract.  So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance.  Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too.  It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent."

2813,March 2015,nyccarguy,"This is true.  I don't have any first hand knowledge.  Don't get me wrong, I do think it is cool that you modified your 320i.  I'm still sticking with my position that I'd take an X1 for basically the same money with the 240 hp (from the factory) version of the N20."

2815,March 2015,flightnurse,"Having spoke to my SA about this and the coding the SA informed me that BMW is aware of BMS, and the 3+ lbs of boost, it is within the limits that BMW has built into the car, Dinan now offers something for the N26/20 engine which add's 4+ lbs of boost, so I guess that is within the limits of the engine too.

2819,March 2015,henryn,"Most people would consider 0-60 in 5.2 seconds to definitely be a ""ball of fire"".  Complete with flames."
2820,March 2015,roadburner,5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. A dead stock 1st. Generation MS3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. Any of the V8 ponycars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less. To be considered very fast these days I'd think that a car has to go 0-60 in under 4 seconds- and 0-100 in under 11 seconds. The goalposts have moved quite a bit.
2821,March 2015,roadburner,"To each his own, my tweaked MS3 is only a tick faster; I can't say it's slow, but it's not a rocketship by current standards."
2822,March 2015,sweendogy,The ilx at 6.2 is a dog.
2823,March 2015,roadburner,"Same here; it really feels different from the newer cars. Contrast that with the X6 I drove at the press intro a few months ago- it was pretty quick but dull as dishwater to drive; a totally uninvolving steer, as the Brits would say."
2824,March 2015,robr2,"You know, we've got it pretty good.  In the 80's and early 90's, a 0-60 of under 10 seconds was IMPRESSIVE."
2825,March 2015,roadburner,"I'd say that was true in the '70s, but not in the '80s or '90s. My 1988 M6 could do 0-60 in the high 5 second range with a Dinan or Conforti chip. The 325i and 535i were 7 second cars, easy. The Mustang GT and Z28 were also 6 second cars by the late '80s."
2826,March 2015,nyccarguy,"Agree with your assessment.  I've driven a friend's F10 ///M5.  The car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring.  I've told him a few times that the ///M5 wasn't ""the car"" to buy at the $130K price point.  He couldn't swing (or should I say, his wife's trust fund woudn't allow) the $150K plus for a Panamera Turbo and wouldn't drive a ""regular"" Panamera 4S because it wasn't the fastest ""top of the line"" model."
2827,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I kinda doubt one would even feel the difference between a 4.5 car and a 5.0 car.  To me, radical speed is something like the Ariel Atom, which is under 3 seconds and probably feels completely different from a 4.5 car."
2828,March 2015,sweendogy,Would say this 0-6O just a measure - real world passing is where its at on the highway - being able to just blast the gas at 45 and loook down and see 65/70 in a blink is where its at. Did it today just to get around slower traffic: gonzo - pretty good 2/3/5/7 seconds (dk.)
2829,March 2015,dino001,"European magazines have additional additional tests, not known here, such as equivalent of going from 40 to 60 mph, or 50 to 75 mph on on highest, or second highest gear to assess flexibility of the engine, as well as its performance.  This was especially important for manual transmission cars, to get you feel how much you need to operate that stick."
2830,March 2015,nyccarguy,Like in my Prelude.  Loafing along at 70 in 5th & need to pass?  Drop down to 3rd & up shift back up to 4th at 80;)
2831,March 2015,roadburner,"That is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. It's one place my MS3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match."
2832,March 2015,henryn,"Back in the day, no one ever talked about 0-60 times.  It was always quarter mile times.  I had a 69 Charger 440, which could get in the 13's with street tires, and in the 12's with slicks.  That was pretty d___ quick for a daily driver in those days."
2833,March 2015,andres3,"I think if GM wants to be treated seriously by most buyers they are going to have to make cars that don't go into limp mode at a weekend HPDE (track event) when they are extremely low miles and unmodified such as the V6 Camaro I rented.  The weather was mildly warm, never got above 85 degrees the whole weekend."
2834,March 2015,robr2,"As I said, under 10 was impressive.  I'm thinking more pedestrian vehicles."
2835,March 2015,roadburner,"As I said, the goalposts have moved, 13 second quarters can now be achieved in many cases with a mildly modified hot hatch."
2836,March 2015,graphicguy,"I concur....I think the prevalence of all these blown motors excel once you get them rolling.  Even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos.  S/Cs are even better."
2837,March 2015,nyccarguy,Why on Gd's Green Earth would you rent a V6 Camaro with an Automatic Transmission and take it to the track?  The auto enthusiasts that track their cars are so few and far between that they barely register on manufacturers' radar.  You want a Camaro suited for the track?  You local Chevrolet dealer will gladly sell you a Z/28 Camaro.
2838,March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,
2839,March 2015,graphicguy,It does indeed.
2840,March 2015,qbrozen,"I disagree. My 3.6L TT CTS has quite a bit more torque than the 5.0L Mustang does, and over a wider RPM band, too. While that Coyote V8 sounds great, runs smooth, revs nicely, etc, I always felt it was a bit weak in the low RPM range."
2841,March 2015,flightnurse,"I think people like to stir the pot... We have car's that are faster, safer, and get better MPG then we had 10,20,30 years ago, but to call a car that can do 0-60 in 5 sec's, the 1/4 in high 14's and still get 30 on the highway is incredible. As I wrote people use to drool over my 302, but show up in a 2015 Mustang GT and those same people would walk away from the 2015 and stand next to the 1970 302 and say, this is a real muscle car...  Roadburner is the same thing, anything new BMW is junk, he loves his son's X3 because it is older.."

He seems to say the Acura 8 speed dual clutch transmission with exclusive torque converter is his favorite transmission in the segment. Comparably equipped he says that it's less than the competition by anywhere from c. $1k to c. $12k. He admits it doesn't have the prestige of the other brands, but likely has better reliability and lower insurance costs. Overall, he says Acura has got its ""mojo back."""
2849,March 2015,benjaminh,Alex also really likes the Audi A3. The 2.0 AWD model he tests has an msrp of c. $40k.
2850,March 2015,sweendogy,"Thanks Ben - interesting review- given discounts and power wonder if the old Infiniti g35/37 or q40 as its weirdly called now would be a better deal. I've seen locals with redic low leases and pricing under 35k, 330 hp strong v6 and premium gas being under 4 bux- I would seriously consider as a major comp to both above. Sure you are driving basically a 10 year old bmw 3 comp but no weird stearing like current infinitis and bmws."
2851,March 2015,stickguy,I knew there was a reason I liked the ILX.  the only thing really wrong with the original was a bit of a weak engine.  that seems to have been cured.
2852,March 2015,tlong,According to Consumer Reports the new Infiniti Q is really poor reliability and not rated very well.
2853,March 2015,kyfdx,"We had a G37 sedan (same car as the Q40) for 3 years..    Not a hiccup.    Stupid amounts of power.  Comparably poor gas mileage.   Numb handling (but adequate).    Nice interior, though a little cramped.  It's a huge amount of car for the money, especially on a lease."

Don't know how many miles, but in 2014 it blew the engine...    He said he took a $10K hit trading it in..  On a new Q50!!"
2857,March 2015,jpp5862,Yeah I wouldn't do that again either.  We have the Q50 Hybrid so it has the venerable 3.5 engine to supplement the hybrid powertrain.  If only they could sort out the electronics.

2861,March 2015,sweendogy,Just double checked CR- the old g37 now q40 still on the recommended list - the new q50 is not and first year buyers have trashed it a bit.
2862,March 2015,tlong,Thanks sween - it just seems that when the G35 and then G37 came out I saw them everywhere. Now either the new version isn't selling well or it is so nondescript that I don't notice it. And why did they change their lettering on that model? I makes no sense to me - I don't have the impression Infiniti is on the upswing...

They could upgrade the current car, restyle as a newer G, and rename to the G39 or something like that. Those original taillights were very distinctive and I could see them replicating something that is similar enough to suggest the old car. And then also address whatever it is about the new car that causes CU and reviewers to not like the new one not so much."

This is all using the remote start ALOT, by the way. I'm guessing the warmer weather will see upwards of 23. Cruising all highway gets me about 26. So its pretty darned close to the mustang. Not surprising given their similar HP and not-so-dissimilar weight. (the extra 2 gears in the CTS is probably what offsets the extra 200 lbs and thirst of the extra torque.)

The steering and brake feel is spot on and the size is just about right- although it is a extremely porky at over 3800 lbs. 0-60 in 6 seconds is nothing to write home about, but adequate for its intended purpose.

All they tend to bring in are black, white and silver cars with black interiors. Very rarely will they bring in a vehicle without a black interior regardless of exterior color. It is bizarre."
2878,March 2015,markcincinnati,White is the new black.  According to our BMW store white is the most popular color.  Black and silver are also popular.
2879,March 2015,ab348,Cadillac doesn't even offer a no-charge basic gloss white. The only white is a tricoat that is extra-cost. They do offer a no-charge basic gloss black. But some metallic paints are also no-charge. Go figure.
2880,March 2015,roadburner,The BMW optioning/pricing has always been a bit ridiculous- charging for HIDs? $3k for a locking diff? Both were standard on my MS3 in Grand Touring trim back in

2884,March 2015,flightnurse,One thing I like about the DHP on the X SAV's is they are more rear wheel bias when having fun and once slip is detected then more power goes to the front wheels. Not too sure if this is true on all X-Drive cars...

Given no clear advantage for performance, quality, reliability, that's a dangerous place to be."
2889,March 2015,roadburner,"My sentiments exactly; I've owned 10 BMWs-from an E24 M6 to an E83 truck-over the past 32 years and I completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new Bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive cars(See: HIDs, enhanced Bluetooth and USB connectivity, decent ICE, EHP summer tires, heated seats, etc., etc.)."

2893,March 2015,markcincinnati,"At the risk of getting myself in hot water: NONE, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior AND preferred by a huge number of regular consumers.  Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with."

2895,March 2015,flightnurse,"Mark, BMW builds the 3 series with a manual, IF people do not want all the bells and dodad's, you can order yourself a 328i w/ sport package, and manual, and be able to get about $36K if one does a European Delivery.

But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual.  Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price.  Yes, you can special order them.  But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one.  They're out there.  They're a acarcity, though."
2898,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Thanks, but I did know that it is possible to get the BMW you mention (as well as several Audis, etc.) with a manual.  The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales?  They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature.  WE'VE killed manual transmissions.

Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)"

I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there.  At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger.  Rather than three engines, you get something like eight.  Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options.  Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books.  We enjoy lower price at expense of choices,  limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture.

2956,March 2015,dino001,"I drove ""bare bones"" 328i multiple times, as loaners, each time it was for a couple of days (they always kept my car for service overnight), so I got about a week's worth of standard F30 328.  Still don't care for the steering.  Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension.  Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon.  It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it?  Two reasons - fuel and market demand.  The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units.  The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.  Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about ""such harsh"" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose ""sport suspensions"" generally consist of stones in places of springs"
2957,March 2015,benjaminh,"Acura has been weak when it comes to cars. But maybe, just maybe, they are coming back?"
2958,March 2015,sweendogy,
2959,March 2015,graphicguy,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either."
2960,March 2015,markcincinnati,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo."
2961,March 2015,graphicguy,Mark....bravo.
2962,March 2015,dino001,"I generally agree with you, Mark.  I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements.  There is no deal, if one gets not what they want.  I also totally understand BMW's move.  Calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh"
2963,March 2015,markcincinnati,"OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions.  For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now."
2964,March 2015,dino001,"I was joking with the ""impolite"" comment.  I guess the wink wasn't enough to convey the message...  I can be a lunatic, why not.  Will wear it as a badge of honor."
2965,March 2015,dino001,"BTW, I disagree with all this mess being MY fault.  Don't look at me, I did my part - all my cars, but one had manual transmission. I got a manual, I got sport suspension, I insisted on a factory order with everything I wanted, not the sales manager thought I wanted. So I did my part, yet they still changed that because others didn't. In other word, IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE at fault, namely all other self-described ""enthusiasts"", who couldn't wait six weeks for their car, or had thousand other excuses (my wife won't let me), so they took what was on the lot.  So yeah, I will [non-permissible content removed] a little..."
2966,March 2015,markcincinnati,"I know you were and it did, dino001 -- we're having a snow day here at the office, so I'm pretty much alone, no emails, no phone calls, just white death out my window.  I could hardly be in a better mood and in no way didn't get the ""wink""."
2967,March 2015,markcincinnati,"I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard."
2968,March 2015,roadburner,"It's painfully obvious that you'd encounter enthusiasts at a driving event. You aren't going to meet the dweebs who talk about the ""powerful V6"" in their ""Beamer"" at the Performance Center or at a CCA HPDE."
2969,March 2015,benjaminh,"I have to admit that Audis and BMWs are beautiful cars, at least to me. They call out to me in a way few other cars do. MB, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. But looking at the reviews of the local Audi dealer just now I came across this:"
2970,March 2015,markcincinnati,"roadburner:  You are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that."
2971,March 2015,benjaminh,"markcincinnati: Your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer.  Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:"
2972,March 2015,markcincinnati,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys."
2973,March 2015,graphicguy,"My track days are over.  But, I still like a good handling car.  I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are.  There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago).  Just not so much any more."
2974,March 2015,cdnpinhead,Business is good in Mark land.
2975,March 2015,roadburner,I have to say that I really
2976,March 2015,markcincinnati,roadburner: Amen.
2977,March 2015,graphicguy,"RB....I look at the Korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else.  I would like to get some butt time in a new Genesis, given that they've supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen."
2978,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW.  I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!"""
2979,March 2015,roadburner,Are you referring to
2980,March 2015,markcincinnati,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term)."
2981,March 2015,nyccarguy,"I think a big part of what BMW has lost is that it has cast such a ""large net.""  The current crop of 3 series cars just doesn't do it for me the way its predecessor did.  3 years ago I made a financially dumb move and traded in my 2010 Acura TSX for a leftover 2011 BMW 328xi.  I drove the car once and figured out a way to make it work by leasing the 328xi for 2 1/2 years.  Fast forward to today.  If I still had my Acura (yes I'm a card carrying member of Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous) and said to myself just as I did 3 years ago:  ""You know what, the incentives on this 320xi or 328xd are really strong, I've always wanted a 3er, so let me take a test drive...""  I would have left the dealership with a cold feeling.  175 hp 4cyl engine is ok for me in my $25K Legacy, but 140 hp turbo 4 cyl wouldn't cut the mustard in a $40K BMW 320xi."
2982,March 2015,benjaminh,"Hard for even me to believe, but on the strength of SUVs Acura slightly outsold Cadillac and Audi for Feb:"
2983,March 2015,markcincinnati,I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.
2984,March 2015,benjaminh,Luxury market for Feb:
2985,March 2015,nyccarguy,
2986,March 2015,roadburner,"As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention"
2987,March 2015,tlong,"I had a '98 Audi A4 and loved that car - V6 with a 5 speed manual. It was without a doubt the best driving car I have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. But I got rid of it earlier than any other car I have ever owned - at 88K miles. It was already nickel and diming me with semi-expensive repairs - primarily a cooling system issue that the dealer couldn't seem to resolve but at $750-$1000 per visit while they kept replacing parts - thermostat, fan clutch, etc. So I finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 Acura TL (now at 150K miles). The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4. I really still do miss that Audi. But I really do like the reliability of my Acura."
2988,March 2015,flightnurse,"Dude, you got to drive a 320xd? The only one imported into the US..."

2991,March 2015,nyccarguy,"Sorry.  What is it, a 328xd?  My brain was semi fried from last night's 2 hour & 23 minute commute home (32 miles)."
2992,March 2015,graphicguy,"tlong....for a long time, it looked like the two of us were carrying the Acura banner.  It's up to you now."
2993,March 2015,carnaught,
2994,March 2015,andres3,"The S4 has been guzzling gas in the city/freeway traffic I drive in lately.  I take short trips, lots of traffic lights, and I can see less than 20 MPG with my lead foot in the S4.  I'm not happy about that, but I know it is possible to get 30 MPG in the thing if you maintain a constant high velocity over large distances, and I'm very happy about that."
2995,March 2015,andres3,"I think the 1.8 A3 is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition.  Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot.  In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight."
2996,March 2015,andres3,
2997,February 2015,roadburner,Aside from the NSX I never gave Acura the slightest bit of consideration; when I'm spending $35k or more FWD cars and FWD biased AWD cars simply aren't on my radar.
2998,February 2015,roadburner,"I haven't driven a GS, but to say it's a more engaging drive than an F30 328i is kind of damning with faint praise..."
2999,February 2015,cdnpinhead,Is the Buick FWD?
3000,February 2015,robr2,Yes the Regal they recommend is FWD.  You can get it with AWD and stick if you want.
3001,February 2015,roadburner,I think AWD is only available with the slushbox.
3002,February 2015,sweendogy,I love the anti acura stuff
3003,February 2015,sweendogy,Best car for money
3004,February 2015,sweendogy,
3005,February 2015,andres3,"I did notice a better feel from the S4's 60/40 RWD emphasis with the AWD system, that does make it feel better and more RWD-like.  On the TL-SH-AWD it felt FWD and when you gassed it, you could feel, AND see even graphically on the screen how it shifted some torque rearward, but most of it always started out in front."
3006,February 2015,sweendogy,I would say the best reason to get rid of the TL was its awful looks- people can talk about how close it was to the s4 but in actuality it wasn't - ugly fat and boring - no way to go thu life.
3007,February 2015,brian125,Consumer Reports said it best about the TL.  Looks like it got it with the big ugly stick
3008,February 2015,circlew,"Sweenydog, I am going to price out the lease on the Q next week.  I'd have to add the mileage hit up front since the cheap lease is for 10K miles/yr and I drive 15K."
3009,February 2015,graphicguy,"I get people not liking the styling of the TL.  Personally, I did like it.  I thought it was bold and unique, which suited me fine."
3010,February 2015,nyccarguy,Count me in as a TL-SH AWD fan.  I like the pre & post face lifted versions too.
3011,February 2015,billyperks4,"Me too- gone but not forgotten TL SH (diamond white pearl), six trouble free years."
3012,February 2015,markcincinnati,"I did like my TL SH-AWD Advance.  I thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a Honda that knew somebody.  The air conditioned seats were great.  The power was good, nothing to scare an S4.  The brakes were very weak.  The doors sounded tinny when closed.  It was a beer to the Audi's champagne.  Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4."
3013,February 2015,markcincinnati,"Some may recall that when I wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 Lexus IS350F with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife said, ""we tried the Infiniti and the Acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months."
3014,February 2015,flightnurse,"Mark, when it comes to cars, for me, my all time favorite care was my Alfa GT-V6, it was a poor mans Ferrari..  Talk about soul!!"
3015,February 2015,qbrozen,"Nice! I'm a bit of an Alfa guy and that is one I've always admired, but I was too late to the party and finding a nice one is damned near impossible. I've run across a couple in the past decade, but never at a time I could do anything about it."
3016,February 2015,markcincinnati,"Have you ever been to Munich? If not, I can offer up a couple of restaurant recommendations that are equal to or better than restaurants in New York, Paris, London, Prague and Warsaw.  If you're going to stay in country for more than a few days, I can also suggest a couple of relatively close destinations that are breathtakingly beautiful."
3017,March 2015,flightnurse,"Good GT=V6's are out there just got to pay for them, just like the NSX's..."
3018,March 2015,flightnurse,Mark I'll take you up on that offer and the Neuschwanstein Castle is mandatory when during a BMW ED..
3019,March 2015,benjaminh,"The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points...."
3020,March 2015,ab348,"Well, time will tell. The outgoing model consistently lost every comparison test to the Buick Verano, much less the A3. Once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess."
3021,March 2015,markcincinnati,"Few A3's (at least in our climate in SW Ohio) will not be quattros. Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong."
3022,March 2015,benjaminh,"markcincinnati: You make some good points. But for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about, Acura might be a choice again now. Maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for Acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in Ohio lol? Once the Acura NSX is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?"
3023,March 2015,markcincinnati,Of that I am certain.
3024,March 2015,graphicguy,"I don't know that I'd go so far as to say there's something special about German cars.  I think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not necessaily better, from one marque to the next."
3025,March 2015,roadburner,"Enthusiasts used to buy BMWs because they were great cars. Now many new buyers select a BMWs so that they appear to be an enthusiast- like the clown I met at my dealer's F30 intro; he informed me that  ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."""
3026,March 2015,markcincinnati,"While I do love a debate even a non-mean-spirited argument, I perhaps should perhaps attempt to clarify at least some of my previous comments in response to: "". . . for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about . . . ."""
3027,February 2015,flightnurse,"When you have a product that isn't selling you tend to have a fire sale. People say that Acura has a problem, look at Infiniti, the QX60 is a rebadged Pathfinder, the QX70 hasn't changed in 6 years, theQX50 (EX) again nothing new there... The Q70 stale..."
3028,February 2015,ab348,"Exactly. They can't sell a lot of what they have in the lineup right now. Odd styling, and not much cachet left with the brand. They just fired their US chief within the last week or two. Infiniti needs to turn it around, fast."
3029,February 2015,flightnurse,"The VQ engine is a masterpiece, however, it is a thirsty engine, hopefully Nissan will be able to turn the Infiniti brand around, and they really need to do it quickly..."
3030,February 2015,andres3,Are they really able to sell Q50's for $50K?  Fully loaded with all the bells and whistles???
3031,February 2015,roadburner,Nissan/Infinity needs to fire their stylists; all of their cars(save the 370Z and GT-R) look like they melted in the sun and the SUVs are pretty horrible as well.
3032,February 2015,Michaell,Exactly. Some loyalty and conquest cash goes a long way.
3033,February 2015,stickguy,"well, the answer to the ""can Infiniti sell them for 50k?"" must be No, if they are subsidizing the leases that much!"
3034,February 2015,kyfdx,"In November, current lessees were given an extra $2500 incentive to lease..   that generates a lot of repeat sales..    Our 2011 G37X had an MSRP of $42K and a lease payment of $351/mo.+tax..      That's hard to beat."
3035,February 2015,sweendogy,Why talk about lease prices and not the actual selling price?
3036,February 2015,markcincinnati,I have to assume the Q50 has been an underwhelming sales performer -- hence lease subvention to the rescue.

3044,February 2015,kyfdx,"Yes.. I am saying that they are a great value to lease at $350 compared to the purchase price.  So cheap, that you'll be many thousands worse off by buying the car, then selling it after three years."
3045,February 2015,graphicguy,It's too bad that Infiniti has had troubles in the sales arena.  They used to make some fairly appealing sport-luxury vehicles.  Now?  Not so much.
3046,February 2015,markcincinnati,A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.
3047,February 2015,flightnurse,"I think Acura still have problems, their two best sellers are the MDX and RDX, the MDX is long in the tooth and really isn't competitive in the market (but the lease payments are lower then the competition) and the RDX just got another refresh..  I liked Acura better when they had the Legend and Integra."
3048,February 2015,stickguy,"the MDX was just fully redesigned for 2015 (or was it 2014?).  How did that get long in the tooth already?  Plus I thought it was selling quite well.  The RDX came out for 2013, so this is the normal time for it's mid-cycle refresh."
3049,February 2015,graphicguy,"No disagreements with you or Mark.  Test driving the Q50, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither."
3050,February 2015,ab348,I saw some promo pricing on the TLX advertised on the weekend. First time I have seen them with trunk money.
3051,February 2015,flightnurse,"We drove a MDX and Jeep GC the same day, I liked the ride in the Jeep over the MDX, talk about uninspiring to drive, and the MDX is their best seller...  Your right the RDX was new in 2013, but the refresh will make it more competitive then the MDX.."
3052,February 2015,robr2,Acura sold 2900 TLX's in January compared to 1400 TL's and 900 TSX's in January 2014 - so about a 25% jump compared to the old models it replaces.
3053,February 2015,graphicguy,"I just saw that the Honda President was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things.  The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies."
3054,February 2015,ab348,"I remember late '90s/early '00s, I thought of Acura as an aspirational brand, out of my price range at the time but something I might consider later on when I could afford one. Now they are not on my radar nor are they in any way appealing."
3055,February 2015,graphicguy,"I just saw a blurb last night that I think came from CR.  Now, aside from appliances and lawn mowers, for which I seek out their ratings, for cars I don't use them all that much."

Every 2-3 hours I drove one or the other up or down my 1500' driveway to keep the snow knocked down. The Bridgestone Blizzak LM-25 tires worked a treat, as the Brits would say; on the first run a few drifts were higher than the fog lamps."
3073,February 2015,stickguy,seems like that would have been natural duty for the Wrangler.  Guess you wanted to do it in comfort.
3074,February 2015,roadburner,"The Wrangler went out first because I wanted to make sure that there were no trees down or other problems. The MS3 was the real snow excavator, it was the least competent due to the lower rid height and the fact that it is running UHP all season tires- the Wrangler and 3er both sport winter rubber."
3075,February 2015,graphicguy,"CTS4 did great.  Standard All Seasons did a good job.  Other folks on the road, especially in SUVs?  Some, not so good.  Saw a few off the side of the road."
3076,February 2015,graphicguy,"Yeah...I see where you're coming from.  But, there are some here at Edmunds who have gone out and bought one for the same reasons they list."
3077,February 2015,qbrozen,"Well, why I usually am left confused by such a list is the breakout of the categories. So the Charger is a sport sedan? Really? Not quite the classification I would give it. On top of that, why are Luxo Sedans mutually exclusive from Sport Sedans? And same goes with Family Sedan. So the Charger isn't a Family Sedan?? Its just all so convoluted so they can list whatever they want. They decide they want to mention a particular car, so they make up yet another category for it. Note the 3 choices for Best Dream Machine. Why can't there be 1 winner there? And why were they too lazy in that instance to not make up 3 separate categories for them? ""Best Dream Machine AWD Coupe-like Sedan,"" ""Best Hybrid German Coupe Over $100k,"" and ""Best Italian Hybrid Supercar."" There ya go."
3078,February 2015,andres3,I'm jealous you guys in the snow get to have fun like this guy:
3079,February 2015,robr2,What a DB.  Former BMW driver I guess.
3080,February 2015,ab348,"No snow fun here. The storm was Sunday - started out with about 8-10"" of snow, then changed to rain for an hour or so, then about 2 hours of freezing rain with a flash freeze as temps plummeted. The result of it all was that everything had 1""-2"" of ice on pavement/sidewalks under the snow crust. I didn't even try to drive anywhere until today after 2 days of clearing efforts around the house. The roads here are atrocious. Even main routes aren't all down to bare pavement since there is caked ice stuck to the pavement in areas that is really hazardous. Side streets are still mostly all ice since it has been too cold for road salt to do much. Add to that all the snowbanks from previous storms making roads narrow, with many merge lanes on expressways simply not there. I'm not going anywhere over the next few days because it is still too risky."
3081,February 2015,laurasdada,"Annual Father/Son ski trip to Sunday River in Maine this week.  Left a day earlier than planned as predictions of blizzard conditions Sunday morning.  So, drove through some blizzard conditions Saturday night!  The XF was a rock star, AWD/All Seasons tracked steady and true.  Stopped for dinner in York, pulled up restaurants on the Nav, told son to pick one.  I guess I missed the turn as we found ourselves driving through residential, one lane (due to snow) roads that hadn't been plowed recently.  So, probably 6+"" snow, no problem for the XF!  Used the rear foglight, oversight on Jag's part, no front fogs...  One hour dinner, 2+"" new snow on top of the car!  But, light and fluffy."

3083,February 2015,sweendogy,I run '18 winter spt dunlops - they have done the job thus far in the great white north east. Amazing how much snow = 90 inches in a month. The car kills it in light snow and is fun to get a little sideways. Im afraid to hit the gas when the snow gets deeper or at night. The video above I have seen before highlights Quattro but also brute force of a beast tuned car - if you had a 500 hp subi it would do the same in similar snow. The car being lower then a normal a4 I'm afraid to push it as those foglights can be expensive to replace

3088,February 2015,robr2,"I have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice.  Most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the Honda, VW and Ford dealerships.  I go in with a good attitude.  If there is a problem with the service work, they know I will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey.  I try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue."
3089,February 2015,benjaminh,Good thinking lol! Hadn't thought of that. Might try that someday....
3090,February 2015,markcincinnati,"Assuming my comments are not banned:  We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati.  I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection."
3091,February 2015,sweendogy,"Acura- this page and others on edmunds seemed to always be - let's see how good this new acura is- and the Tsx is a comp to others- and the TL is an poor mans s4. but acura for the last 15? Years has not done anything in sedan form. If you want a great Acura sedan (or coupe) get the second gen type2 legend -(6 speed please, google it)  (the square TL /s another) and also the bug eyed integra GS-r.  The last TL, the last Tsx and the first ILX - no good -(all ugly and could not match comp)  the RLX no one buys. The new TLX from reports is nice but nothing special- You can look at zero to sixty numbers and cost of new ILX (for 16) vs its comp but is it really in this class? It's still a civic under the skin and until Acura runs a turbo 4 it's a back burner car at best - Infiniti after gaining so much traction is now nowhere as well- maybe the parents don't care -"

3095,February 2015,graphicguy,"Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership.  I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep.  Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont).   We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference).  I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again.  The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership.  I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that."
3096,February 2015,roadburner,"That's just about the same policy I follow. My SA at my BMW dealer is also a CCA member and attends HPDEs in his 1998 M3. I've also built a relationship with one SA at my Mazda dealer. I've also written letters of praise to the corporate offices; in 1996 I even received a personal reply from Vic Doolan, who at that time was the President of BMWNA. It's amazing to see what happens when you are courteous and don't treat the dealer as an adversary..."
3097,February 2015,robr2,"And as I noted, I don't burn them on surveys.  If I have a problem, I speak with them directly.  A couple of years ago I had the timing belt done on my Passat.  About 30 days later, the thermostat went.  It requires just about the same labor time to reach the tstat as to get to the timing belt.  I mentioned it to the service manager and he went through my customer history.  He noted how much I've spent there, if I was asked if I wanted to change the tstat when they did the timing belt and I'm sure somewhere in there is my CSI report.  Viola - 3 hour labor credit."
3098,February 2015,roadburner,Exactly. The surveys are ridiculous to begin with- anything less than a top mark being considered a failure.
3099,February 2015,sweendogy,Finally alive again - nice work men. My anger with Acura (don't get me going on Infiniti) is they were so close and they blew it. They had the turbo and shelved it. They had cool names and ofcourse the reliability.  The ILX is basically a TSX gen one reborn - - which is a good thing but the true comp has them beat. I don't have the numbers but my audi dealer has 60 a3s on the lot and 3 of them are the 1.8. Read caranddriver.com for there take and it's not a good read for the ILX. Weight 63% front should be fun on the twists go.

3101,February 2015,flightnurse,"I remember talking about the CTS and how I liked it and you mentioned that you wouldn't step in a Caddy dealer because of how they treated your mother many years prior, but giving you 15K off MSRP changed that for you.... Now if the dealer came back with only 7% off MSRP would you have taken the dealer?   But in the end, money talks and did for you... I'm sure anyone would have taken the dealers deal of 15K off a 60K car I'm sure you lease payments are lower then what your TL was. Dealer experience goes only so far, it's nice to go to my BMW dealer and help myself to the coffee bar and pastries, but I'd rather not have to go to the dealership at all."

But, breakfast stuff (donuts), little water bottles, a TV, and a small business area if you want a desk or PC..  Good enough for me, since I go there every 6-7 months when the little wrench comes on, and just drive into the express lane (no appointment) and am done in an hour or less.  maybe slightly longer if I was do for extra stuff."
3103,February 2015,m6user,"According to this article, Acura may be bringing back the Type S designation in the form of a turbo 4 cyl producing 300+ hp.  I think that would make the ILX, which it is apparently slated for, more than competitive."

For your $300 they probably do lube things (joints/hinges, ect.) do a 150 pt. inspection, but in the end, it's just an oil change.   I got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off I felt as I was being ripped off (I originally thought 15K service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!).  They are making their maintenance intervals a lot longer it seems."
3109,February 2015,andres3,"At my last HPDE event I won an auction to get more than half off on a Audi S4 3.0 Supercharge tune that takes the S4 to 400+ HP.  They couldn't make the tune happen on a Sunday, so it'll happen at my next HPDE event in March.  This is a tune that turns the S4 into a M3 killer.  Since my car has been pretty much flawless, I think I will go ahead and risk the potential ""warranty"" issues.   It's already a beast; should be fun."

They tout that their prices are in line with other national car service places.  They say they'll meet or beat any other store on tire prices.  And, they're charging $70 for a synthetic oil change, tire rotation and whatever inspections BMW requires."
3112,February 2015,markcincinnati,"I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5,  S6 and S7, for instance.  Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic.  The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine.  The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.)."
3113,February 2015,sweendogy,M
3114,February 2015,andres3,I guess they figure a lot of Audi owners are made of money and won't shop around.
3115,February 2015,andres3,"I'm not worried about it.  When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one.  Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless.  Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque.  I'm not too worried about it.  I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."

3117,February 2015,brian125,I like the S3. Sharp looking but small.  The 19' performance pck/ tires look awesome on this vehicle.  Wondering what the mpg's are on the 2.0 turbo???
3118,February 2015,graphicguy,"Had a chance to drive an S3 while I was in Indianapolis about a week ago.  I usually don't do test drives unless I'm at least contemplating a car, which I'm not.  But, as visiting my sister and on the way, with some time to kill, I passed an Audi dealer.  Pulled in and saw they had 3 S3s.  Dealer plate on and away we went."
3119,February 2015,kyfdx,Can you get it with a stick?
3120,February 2015,andres3,"You'll have to settle for the Golf R for a stick option.  If you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically.  I still think the Audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value.  From what I've seen, there's better quality control in Ingolstadt than Mexico."
3121,February 2015,andres3,"I need to ask, what are/were the symptoms of the ""binding"" Quattro AWD system in your S4?  How did you notice it?  Did it happen every time? occasionally?  Did it worsen over time?"
3122,February 2015,graphicguy,"kyfdx...no stick on the S3 (at least that's what the sales person said).  The MSRP on the one I drove, which was fairly loaded up (but you could add even more) was knocking on the $50K door, but you could still add more to it."

3128,February 2015,dino001,"I recall Audi used to sell 4-year maintenance package for around $500 (A4 price).  With $300 right out of the gate, this would have been a bargain.   It was even more attractive with lease as it increased the residual by couple of percent, too.  Do they still do that, or did their prices increased?"
3129,February 2015,kyfdx,"The price is around $850 for 3 years...   On a lease, it adds 1% to the residual, so the actual cost is closer to $400..    Which is pretty cheap for three years of scheduled maintenance."

I really liked the interior and size.  Upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed.  and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal."
3139,February 2015,graphicguy,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX.  Wife tried one before settling on the Accord.  Tough sell.  Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord.  Hard to make that fly."
3140,February 2015,henryn,"The dealership experience makes all of the difference, doesn’t it?  When I was younger, I could not understand why anyone would pay the money for a new Cadillac.  Then I owned my first Cadillac (not new, but new enough to be under factory warranty).  After that, I truly did understand."
3141,February 2015,roadburner,"Exactly, my wife is extremely reluctant to buy anything other than a CPO BMW because of the great treatment we receive from both the sales and service departments."
3142,February 2015,andres3,VW dealerships don't have a stellar reputation.  My experience with Audi dealers has been perfectly fine.  They should definitely work at dropping the bad apples.
3143,February 2015,robr2,Now I've had a great relationship with my VW dealer and service department.
3144,February 2015,henryn,"I can highly recommend West Houston Volkswagen.  Their service department treats you so well, you will swear it's a Cadillac dealership.  Archer Volkswagen (also here in Houston), well, you will swear you're at the Ford dealership service department (which is NOT a good thing!)."
3145,February 2015,ab348,"Dealer experience seems entirely local and hence quite variable. Last night on the news I saw a report of a Mini owner whose car had a bad engine just out of warranty and who had a very bad experience with her dealer and BMW Canada corporate. The local BMW/Mini dealer (not the one in the TV report) had a very bad rep for customer service but has recently been sold to one of the two local dealer groups, the same one I bought my ATS from, who probably will be better. The former owner's rep couldn't be much worse than what it was."
3146,February 2015,graphicguy,"Dealerships go a long way to form the perception of any brand.  I've been born beat even by Mercedes dealerships, and I've been treated like gold at Chevy dealerships.  At the Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes dealerships, you expect better, though.  You expect the sales and service reps to listen and respond to what you want or need.  Not to resort to arm twisting to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car."
3147,January 2015,zandor,"If you can get a tune that keeps the warranty I wonder why it wasn't standard in the first place.  I bet gas mileage will drop in exchange for that 90 lb-ft.  Sell a gimped but still quick car with decent mileage, report decent mileage to the government for CAFE purposes, then sell a cheap ECU flash that un-gimps the engine..."
3148,January 2015,roadburner,My mildly tuned MS3 develops an average of 50 lb-ft of torque over the stock engine from 3000 rpm to 6000 rpm and fuel economy actually improved a bit- when I can resist the urge to stay out of boost...
3149,January 2015,qbrozen,"So, yes, if you drive the vehicle to its potential (where you are actually utilizing that extra power), you will burn more fuel. So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation. (that is, of course, for cars with a good reputation)"
3150,January 2015,flightnurse,"My tune on my BMW has not affected my MPG at all, I'm still averaging 30."
3151,January 2015,markcincinnati,Getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is:
3152,January 2015,qbrozen,"Yeah, I have absolutely no intention of tuning my caddy. The only time I would ever see the results would be at the track, so its just not worth it."

3154,January 2015,qbrozen,"I want to, I plan to, when I can afford it. Unfortunately, I never did take my mustang to the track while I owned it. We took a big vacation last summer instead, so I didn't feel comfortable burning the money on a track trip. Who knows what this year will bring?"
3155,January 2015,roadburner,My modifications to the MS3 have been ridiculously cheap. I spent just $545 for a new Mazdaspeed intake and $230 for a used Hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. A stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the Focus ST was a whopping $59.97.
3156,January 2015,thebean,"To me, this vacation sounds like a much better use of money.  More than just you can enjoy a vacation.  So, kudos to you for this.  Unless you have money to burn (which I never have had), track stuff seems pretty selfish to me.  There is not much in life I enjoy more than a good vacation.  YMMV, as always."

3158,January 2015,roadburner,Thank heavens my wife doesn't begrudge me a few track weekends  per year. They relax me more than a vacation- but we take one or two of those as well...
3159,January 2015,andres3,"I finally got to track my big heavy S4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that.  The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads.   I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too).  I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power.  Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers,  in frozen weather for the NE USA.  Not for warm Southern CA tracks.  Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's."
3160,January 2015,qbrozen,"I did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day HPDE. The stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them."
3161,January 2015,andres3,"If I recall, the 135i weight advantage over the 335i is fairly small right?  If I would have skipped the last 2 sessions I wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs.   The tracks are a long drive from San Diego and I track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so I had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary."
3162,January 2015,qbrozen,"My challenge, and why I tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. Took me a couple HPDEs, but I finally figured out what the problem was. The TCS on that car had 3 settings. On; 1 push to turn off the TCS but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. The middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. Well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, I realized that every time I would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. I finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. It pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. Huge difference."
3163,January 2015,flightnurse,Here is a small article on the new
3164,January 2015,graphicguy,"FN...just saw that article last night.  Jags have never been on my radar, but that one looks interesting. It will be a while before it gets here, but will at least do a test drive."

3166,January 2015,flightnurse,"GG as I posted by the time it arrives all the other sport sedan will have fixed their short comings to a point, so Jag better have it's game on..."
3167,January 2015,benjaminh,"Acura's ILX, up until this point, has been almost a joke because of the lackluster 2.0 engine. But the new ILX is going to get standard the direct-injected 2.4 liter with the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter from the larger TLX. The TLX 2.4 was tested by Motor Trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. But since the ILX will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, I'm thinking that the new ILX will really be quite a performer for the price. It's expected to start at c. $28k msrp."
3168,January 2015,graphicguy,"Yeah....that's a lot of time to pass.  I hear that BMW is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time.  Audi's current A/S/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the S4 is still running with  the pack)."
3169,January 2015,flightnurse,"GG, for 2016 the 3 series enters it's Mid Life cycle and gets updated, with new engines ""B"" series engines which are to make more power and be more efficient, better steering and upgrade interior.  I hope the new Jag is a home run which makes everybody else do better."
3170,January 2015,andres3,"Yes, Acura has gone backwards in almost every category of measurement with the TLX from the TL."
3171,January 2015,laurasdada,"I'm torn:  I want to see Jag thrive, but (at least around here) I love not seeing one on every street corner a la 3, C and A4.  Or in my case, 5, E and A6.  The XF is probably more car/bigger than I need, so I'm intrigued by the XE.  Although, I was hoping for styling other than MinimeXF."
3172,February 2015,graphicguy,"LD....I think I mentioned that my best friend bought a new Sting Rey convertible.  Just an incredible car.  His will be a Queen Bee, though.  He'll only take it out when it's sunny and warm enough to put the top down.  No track.  No long trips."
3173,February 2015,roadburner,A friend of mine just bought a new Stingray with
3174,February 2015,graphicguy,RB....my friend went in the opposite direction with his Vette.  He got a 1LT (lowest package with Z51 pack and Magnetic Ride Contro.  No automatic.  No Nav.  Pretty much a stripped version (or more stripped than you usually find them).

Cool looking cars- good to see reliability has come back but as others state above- I'm a car guy and I have not driven a caddy in my life- I'm mid thirties - in fact I have not been in one or a Lincoln in 10 years (not including biz trips to and from the airport runs). I'm trying to put a finger on why I have not driven/looked at one- recall concerns seem like a cop out, no one I know owns them-"
3178,January 2015,Michaell,"Should my lottery numbers ever hit or I get a large inheritance from a rich relative I don't know, I'm very interested in the ATS Coupe.

3180,January 2015,robr2,That's true but very often one person will remark about their uncle's co-worker's sister that had a flat tire on her 1972 Deville and many accept that as proof that Cadillac must still make bad cars.

3189,January 2015,markcincinnati,"I'm now at 22,000 miles on my '14 S4 -- the car, in every way has been flawless.  Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal.""  The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile.  However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless).  Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers."
3190,January 2015,qbrozen,"speaking of infotainment systems, I don't understand all the media hate of CUE. I prefer it to the system in my wife's Chrysler. I find it easier to navigate and certainly offers more features. Hell, at least Siri works with it, which is more than I can say for the Chrysler. Anyway, I like CUE. Just putting that out there."
3191,January 2015,graphicguy,"I concur.  Matter of fact, I consider it the best piece of automotive GPS/Voice/Touch control on the market.  And, I've used Audi's MMI, BMW's iDrive and Acura Link.  Even the ""MyCadillac/OnStar"" app is great.  I can remotely start th ecar, see current MPG on the current tankful, find where I parked my car, lock/unlock the car, download addresses from the internet to the car's GPS, etc."

3194,January 2015,andres3,"I dragged myself to a Caddy dealer to drive one for the first time before easily deciding to get the (ordered from Germany in August 2013) S4 for more bang for my buck.  I drove the ATS 2.0T and 3.6.  The high sticker shock was tremendous and a first strike.  A minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and I just didn't feel the in the pants OOMPH from the butt Dyno I wanted to feel.  I may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because I think programming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in programming?"
3195,January 2015,andres3,"When did GM end the across the board 5 yr./100K miles Power Train Warranty?  That was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70.   I remember they even extended that old 100K warranty to SAAB."
3196,January 2015,markcincinnati,Reliable and Durable:
3197,January 2015,roadburner,My Club Sport track rat has over 140k on it with no major repairs; ditto for my 148k MS3. My son's X3 has nearly 170k on it with one major repair- but since I haven't had a car payment since 2006 I think I'm still ahead of the game.
3198,January 2015,graphicguy,"Mark....well said.  I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history."
3199,January 2015,stickguy,"on the flip side GG, the thought of keeping these modern hi-tech marvels for a long time/lot of miles is scary.  My 2000 TL went 175K for me, but that car was a relative ox-cart compared to yours.  The only worry I had was the tranny crapping out, and that was still simple even if it would cost around 3K!  The rest of the fancy stuff was basic (bun warmers, BOSE radio, normal power options).  I changed out the suspension front and rear on sale at Sears for about $600."
3200,January 2015,qbrozen,"Huh. But you were looking at Challengers, right? I'm surprised considering the cars you seem to love are pretty lightweight. You checked out the Toyobaru, right? I would imagine the power is a letdown, though. What else have you tried out? New Stang, perhaps?"
3201,January 2015,graphicguy,"Stick...all good points.  I don't think I worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that I keep a car outside the warranty term.  I can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like iDrive, MMI, CUE, etc.  Then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware."
3202,January 2015,roadburner,"I still like the Challenger R/T and SRT,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the SRT is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars I've looked at just aren't."
3203,January 2015,sweendogy,Eco boost stang getting good press and looks like its easy to toon.
3204,January 2015,graphicguy,Sweet!
3205,January 2015,roadburner,You will soon be able to get a tune from Ford Racing that provides a healthy power bump yet preserves the factory warranty. The FRPP tune for the Focus ST boosts midrange torque by 90 lb-ft.
3206,January 2015,sweendogy,If it's around 2k I would really consider this if I had the Eco stang. Lighter then gt - good fuel Eco and close figures on paper
3207,December 2014,markcincinnati,"Wow! That's variety.  My question is this:  would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US?  And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US.  My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the  range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice."
3208,December 2014,roadburner,"As I noted in another topic, in 2007 I wrote an article on the international launch of the E93. I noted that BMW would sell every one they make, even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt. The latest BMWs aren't nearly that bad-yet-but perhaps the tagline ""The Ultimate Fashion Accessory"" would be a more accurate advertising theme."
3209,December 2014,stickguy,"I actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for.  Simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper.  More of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series cars than a massively powered 335.  The volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right?"
3210,December 2014,roadburner,"I'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- I just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a BMW, at any rate."
3211,December 2014,graphicguy,Sorry FN....just saw your question.  Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.
3212,December 2014,billyperks4,Graph- Can I ask? Why did you get rid of your TL?
3213,December 2014,graphicguy,RB...you're a track guy.  I admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people I know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars).
3214,December 2014,circlew,"No question, happened to me on the '06 330xi I leased.  Made the station pay for a new rim!"

3219,December 2014,circlew,
3220,December 2014,graphicguy,"circle....good points.  I think Cadillac is going through a transition.  Not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to Benz or Audi or BMW.  My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus.  Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two.  What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6."
3221,December 2014,carnaught,"Graphic, question for you.  What are you getting for gas mileage?  I realize that this is a minor issue currently while gas/oil prices are at a several year low.  To me, in 2015 (well just about), along with style and other features, I just can't hang my hat on cars getting 18-22 mpg unless they're high performance or ultra-luxury vehicles.  Like the new Caddy's though except the SRX doesn't do anything for me."
3222,December 2014,graphicguy,"carnaught.....still in break in.  Only 4 fillups so far.  1st tank-19MPG.  2nd tank-21MPG...all city.  3rd tank was 24MPG, about 50-50 city/highway."

3225,December 2014,sweendogy,"Ok well I officially call this deal the best of all time'- infact in my region within 250miles there are 6 TLs  that are priced higher then your trade in price, all are 2014s with the exception of one 13 that has half the miles you traveled. Add in the ridiculous deal you got on the cts and it adds up to a nice kia."
3226,December 2014,graphicguy,Thank you Sween.  Motivated dealer who wanted to right a wrong and move into the customer service top tier was the key to the deal.
3227,January 2015,sweendogy,"Redic motivated - I hope the cts adds up to a good car for you. 100x better looking then the tL, as we can now agree was an amazingly ugly/ not so much in post surgery - but the early 08/11 wow Really bad. If you can get 6k off the CtS in 2 years please give me a call before you do it- need to see the approach"
3228,January 2015,graphicguy,"Losing $6K depreciation on the CTS probably isn't in the cards.  But, I bought it right.  So, it will all even out."
3229,January 2015,flightnurse,Here is an article by
3230,January 2015,tlong,I think the reason people aren't buying Caddys is that their traditional demo is dying off and the younger set is seeing the taint of decades of GM mediocrity and reliability issues.
3231,January 2015,benjaminh,And the new head of Cadillac has the very odd view that fewer sales are somehow better.....???
3232,January 2015,Michaell,
3233,January 2015,robr2,...and I believe that the younger set aren't seeing the taint of their grandpa's Caddy whereas they don't want to drive their father's Mercedes.
3234,January 2015,graphicguy,I used to tell my sales staff that high sales volume at low margins does not mean they're good at their jobs.  High margins coupled with high volumes were the keys to success.
3235,January 2015,qbrozen,"well, Caddy has really stepped up on peace of mind. 4yr/50k bumper-to-bumper, 4yr/50k included maintenance, and 6yr/70k power train. Is there a better standard coverage offering in the lux market?"
3236,January 2015,ab348,"Exactly. All these things are cyclical. Look at the reliability/warranty issues that Audi and BMW seem to experience. I would be shocked if Cadillac wasn't far superior. I tell you, if anyone drives an ATS like mine for any length of time, they are going to be won over. I was out in it today and it is the first time maybe ever that I kept driving around randomly, just for the sake of having fun. What a hot-rod hoot of a machine that thing is! I love it."
3237,December 2014,roadburner,"I'm trying to keep an open mind, but the only BMWs I could imagine owning are the M235i(w/port-installed locking diff) and the M3/4. Everything else from Munich bores me to tears(and don't get me started on the X5 and X6- I almost fell asleep driving the F16 at its international launch). I only want a manual with RWD, so that means if I stay German I'll be looking at a Cayman S."
3238,December 2014,sweendogy,"I had no idea the ""coding"" potentials of these cars. Was always aware of ""the chip"" upgrade that would turn a 1.8 audi/vw engine into a monster- but never the technology to unleash options not paid for from the manufactures. Maybe buying el cheapo is the way to go."
3239,December 2014,roadburner,It used to be possible to unlock the Mazdaspeed 3 Grand Touring trim level's trip computer on the Sport trim level-it was all done through the audio buttons/knobs-but Mazda got wise and it wasn't possible on later editions.
3240,December 2014,stickguy,I just saw my SILs next X6. Very sharp. And big. Replaced her 2011 535x.
3241,December 2014,nyccarguy,"I'm ok with something on the boring side for my daily driver.  Point it south down the interstate to get to work, point it north up 3 different parkways to get home.  Speed limits ranging from 45 - 55.  I've learned to like my 175 hp, 4cyl, AWD, Legacy."
3242,December 2014,roadburner,"I put quite a few miles on a fully loaded X6 xDRIVE50i at the launch. Beautiful interior, totally uninvolving to drive. Sleep-inducing, to be blunt."
3243,December 2014,roadburner,Even my work beater has to be entertaining(hence the tweaked MS3)- and now that I'm 100% off the clock I simply refuse to buy a car that doesn't tick all the right boxes.
3244,December 2014,nyccarguy,"The one thing my Legacy has taught me is to appreciate a car for what it is with just some basic options.  I don't miss the sunroof as much as I thought & I actually prefer the slick top look.  Keeping that in mind, I ""built"" some ELLPS sedans to my specifications:"

3249,December 2014,billyperks4,"Flight- nothing to do with warranty, I just like to keep things simple."
3250,December 2014,roadburner,"Yes, really. When I first drove an F10 535i the only thought that came to mind  was ""Old man's car."" My wife later got stuck with an F10 loaner; she drove it home, got out and announced ""It's nothing but a big soft boat. I HATE it!"" The sled sat unused until her car(an E90 328i) was ready to pick up. And most every magazine review agrees with me; numb steering and ponderous handling are noted in virtually every road test."

3252,December 2014,Michaell,Regarding the cheap 320xi lease here in Colorado.
3253,December 2014,graphicguy,"My sister looked at the 3 series (320ix and 328ix) before settling on her Mercedes.  For the money, the 320ix with just a few options is mighty tempting.....especially with the 4 years maintenance included."
3254,December 2014,flightnurse,"I'm sure it's a 39 month lease too, since Oct, BMWFS has been pushing the 39 months lease.. But someone on Bimmerfest leased a 320ix with Premium Package, Lighting package and Nav, his payments were right about what you quoted of $336/m, and all he put down was about $1100. Deals are out there..."
3255,December 2014,flightnurse,"The maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get ONE free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. BMW uses synthetic oil and allows BMW to get away with the longer service intervals.  The real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50K bumper to bumper warranty., So if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50K and save yourself about $1200..."
3256,December 2014,billyperks4,"Road- i guess this is all subjective because I would not give a 328 a second look, not even for my wife. Just personal taste I guess."
3257,December 2014,roadburner,"The 328i was the car she wanted so that was her call. It's certainly no adrenaline rush either- but at least it is possible to determine that the steering wheel is connected to the front wheels. BMW has decided to build the overwhelming majority of its cars to please people who wear their cars rather than drive them- and I'm afraid Munich will find that the people who can't tell which end of the car is driven, or ""need"" AWD, or think that a V6 is under the hood will prove to be a very fickle bunch of poseurs."
3258,December 2014,flightnurse,"Oh lord, BMW is a car company in which it needs to make money, so they build cars that majority of people would buy. If BMW would go back and build just niche cars they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you Road don't buy enough cars to keep BMW open. Yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger cars, just like the Mazda 6, Camry, A4, and C class are bigger then their last generation."
3259,December 2014,sweendogy,"Name calling never ends well- but like flight says a bmw does need to make money - thus the 320 was born. Its ""el cheapo"" bmw that plays many of rolls. It's got a bmw badge, it's cheaper then the old standard ultimate driver that came with a 6, it's holds value to get the lease payments lower (thus allowing ""poseurs"" to ""own"" one), it's great to put in print that you can lease one for 299 a month, It's also great having ""el cheapo"" in the showrooms as it brings in customers looking to go cheap then adding 10k in options or moving entirely up in class because that said bmw doesn't have nav or a cup holder. Point is all lux brands are doing this - makes sense given how close the base bmw (or other luxury cars are, around 30k) and how that compares to mainstream auto prices ."

3261,December 2014,markcincinnati,~
3262,December 2014,roadburner,"I don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional BMW virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. Cadillac and Lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while BMW abandons it. Pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat."
3263,December 2014,cdnpinhead,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties)."
3264,December 2014,cdnpinhead,I'm not.
3265,December 2014,markcincinnati,"The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government.  The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat.  The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it."
3266,December 2014,cdnpinhead,"BMW UK lists 46 variants of the 3-series with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel.  They don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and AWD options that would each have to be certified separately by the EPA at what I'm told is huge expense.  This in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of BMW production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale."
3267,December 2014,nyccarguy,"How many miles are on your 2011 535xi?  What's the original in service date?  $20.5K for the TL is a testament of Acura's excellent resale value, you car's low mileage, and I'm sure it was in exceptional condition."

But Bill did it right, have a big down payment and cheap money factor then a CPO is a great way to get into a luxury car."
3270,December 2014,ivan_99,"I think you're probably right...either new or used I don't like paying for 5 years.  I should make whatever is purchased (new or used) fit in 3 years of payments.  When I get around year 4 I always have the inner dialog ""I'm STILL paying for this...""."

Sure its a responce (or a car in the 320) but is it worthy.  As others have mentioned the CPO finance rates are very close to new car rates. If you can get a Cpo that fits your criteria why would you not want to save first year depresh- even if it's not cpo you can still get a better (than cpo) deal with the balance of a luxury car makers warrantee and get a better car then you would if new. Love cars - like deals- why not get both.

For a low mileage driver, does it make sense to buy a 1 year old car with high miles, then sell as a 4 year old car with normal miles?"
3288,December 2014,m6user,If you can determine if it was used mostly highway and serviced correctly it would make perfect sense IMO.
3289,December 2014,markcincinnati,How about a brand new Buick (the really tiny one) -- the reviews of it as a teeny weenie luxury car have been positive.  That way you can have 100% new everything.
3290,December 2014,thebean,Sarcasm?
3291,December 2014,stickguy,"makes sense to me.  a 1 YO with high miles is going to take a major hit.  Which is good for you.  By the time the miles even out to normal, you might not loose all that much in depreciation."
3292,December 2014,sweendogy,I did the same with my s4- was 9 mths old had 14k - at the 2 year mark it will have less then 24k and at 3 years should be around 30. I don't drive. 2/3k a year closer to. 7-8. Part of reason I went used.
3293,December 2014,billyperks4,So far here is what I like- this is just my personal likes and dislikes-
3294,December 2014,flightnurse,WOW even my El Cheapo 320 has this as part of the premium package.
3295,December 2014,Michaell,"My local BMW dealer is offering $272/mo on a lease of a 320ix ... $40K MSRP and $2500 down (I suspect some of that is for the acquisition fee, but still...). Lot of car for the money."
3296,December 2014,flightnurse,"I'm sure that is for 10K/yr too, but that $2500 down is steep,"
3297,December 2014,flightnurse,"You can't compare a new car and a CPO, some people will only buy new, while others will only buy CPO."
3298,December 2014,flightnurse,"I don't think any one will say the ATS isn't a good car, but for it to compete against cars that are bigger i.e 3 series and A4 and now the new C class GM needed to think ahead, that they didn't.."
3299,December 2014,sweendogy,
3300,December 2014,flightnurse,"A CPO is not a new car, pretty simple.. As I posted some people only want a new car, while others don't care."
3301,December 2014,billyperks4,Flight- I was in that bucket (new only) until I bought this CPO 535- only 28k miles.
3302,December 2014,flightnurse,"Bill, for people who lease, a CPO will not work, those who do not lease, a CPO is a great way to get into a luxury car without selling off their oldest child."
3303,December 2014,nyccarguy,"I can see going CPO if you've got cash in hand, or put a large chunk down and get some cheapo financing for maybe 2 years if you don't drive all that much."
3304,December 2014,billyperks4,NY- I drive only 5-6K per year- I commute into NY via Metro North.
3305,December 2014,nyccarguy,That Metro North ticket is like a car payment itself!
3306,December 2014,robr2,True but he can deduct the Metro North pass from his taxes.  You can't do do with a car payment in most cases.
3307,December 2014,sweendogy,"I drive 8k a year and could of bought a new s4- but went slightly used, saved 10k or more, have full warranty, and know if I want to sell it I won't take a bath, paid cash plus trade- would do it again. First year depreshiayion is a [non-permissible content removed]."
3308,December 2014,nyccarguy,"There's no right or wrong answer to the question either.  I've only owned or leased new cars since I got my license (except for a used 1990 BMW 325i Coupe I bought for $950).  I am open to CPO cars especially in this segment for a future purchase.  Our Pilot is about a year & a half away from being paid off.  I know my wife drives it because we have 3 kids and need a big, family, truckster.  We could keep the Pilot around for kid hauling, car pooling, & vacation duty and pick up a CPO ELLPS for her to drive.  I'd look at an IS350, previous body style C300 4Matic, heavily depreciated CTS or ATS..."
3309,December 2014,billyperks4,I would go CPO again and I probably will in a few years- the 650 XI would be coming off leases   then.
3310,December 2014,roadburner,"My wife's last two cars(her current E90 and the E83 passed down to RB Jr.) were CPOs, but I doubt that either of us will be buying another BMW; while their reliability has been excellent, driving excitement has gone MIA in the Fxx cars/trucks..."
3311,December 2014,andys120,There are so many complex systems in today's  Luxury and near-lux cars that it might be worthwhile to offer how-to seminars.  A buddy of mine bought a new E350 and clearly hadn't had the time to learn  most of the systems.
3312,December 2014,ivan_99,I don't think I'd do a CPO again.
3313,December 2014,billyperks4,No lower class for me- always looking to upgrade.
3314,December 2014,flightnurse,"I think some are missing my point, I'm sure Mark leases his car's for tax breaks, so buying a CPO wouldn't work for him. Buying a CPO can be a smart choice for some, just like buying new is a smart choice for others. Rick at one time was looking at a Lexus LS460 but the original sticker was over the top, even though the car residual for very high, the payments were higher then what he was willing to pay, so he was looking at a CPO LS 460. But he came to his senses and moved on...  BTW, leases residuals for Lexus's are out of this world, RX is 67%, LS 66%.."
3315,December 2014,nyccarguy,Same for the IS350 - residuals are nuts!
3316,December 2014,nyccarguy,You and I are in the same boat.  I don't want to be making payments on a car that's more than 5 years old plus pay for maintenance & out of warranty repairs.
3317,December 2014,sweendogy,The payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. Yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less  and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.
3318,December 2014,stickguy,"I agree with Sween.  And NYC.  NYC in that I don't want to pay on a car more than 4-5 YO.  And sween that if you are, you spent too much on the CPO."
3319,December 2014,roadburner,"That's what we do; we've had our newest car(the CPO E90) for 2.5 years and will probably keep it an additional 3-5 years. Our next newest car(the 2007 MS3, bought new) has been in the garage 7.5 years."
3320,December 2014,stickguy,"makes sense, and I have done the same thing.  How old it is when you get it shouldn't change your tolerance for how long to keep a car."
3321,December 2014,billyperks4,"""makes sense, and I have done the same thing. How old it is when you get it shouldn't change your tolerance for how long to keep a car."""
3322,December 2014,dino001,"To be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact.  Having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that.  It's a false choice between a new non-luxury or used luxury brand for those who have to borrow money for long term to buy it.  That choice only works financially when one can pay cash or takes a two or three year loan."
3323,December 2014,billyperks4,"I took a three year loan paying .90 bps (pretty cheap loan), they gave me 20.5K for the TL - I think I did okay."
3324,December 2014,roadburner,Now I'm confused; I thought you bought an F10 535i.
3325,December 2014,graphicguy,"Twin scroll turbo is what billy meant, maybe?"
3326,December 2014,billyperks4,yup- twin scroll.
3327,December 2014,ab348,"I have a few pet peeves. One is calling an intake manifold a ""dome"""
3328,December 2014,roadburner,"""Serious Buyers Only"" is another of mine..."
3329,December 2014,markcincinnati,"You may know that my wife and I, after decades of German only, went with an Infiniti and an Acura (2011 and 2012 respectively).  She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months."
3330,December 2014,flightnurse,"Mark, we are looking at a SUV for Rick, and at the Phoenix Auto Show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the SUV's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. So far the BMW X3 and Audi Q5 are the two top contenders. At the Auto Show we looked at the MB GLA, GLK, and ML. The GL is just too big (this is Ricks words, not mine.) the GLA I was impressed with, but too small, the GLK was too small, the ML I found to be just right. What I found interesting with the ML was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. We test drove a ML250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, I was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the Audi or BMW. But the size was just right, slightly bigger then the Audi and BMW, but smaller then the X5 and Q7."
3331,December 2014,graphicguy,"Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf."
3332,December 2014,nyccarguy,A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS.  We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet.  The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.
3333,December 2014,roadburner,"The emphasis has shifted from driving dynamics to technology- either entertainment or electronic nannies. I guess that's understandable; 99% of buyers in this segment believe that ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Cheap Trick and think ""contact patches"" are used to help you quit smoking..."
3334,December 2014,markcincinnati,Roadburner -- you crack me up! Of course the Cheap Trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have I).
3335,December 2014,graphicguy,"Mark....interesting take, as always."
3336,December 2014,dino001,"I was recently browsing local inventory of BMW and Benz dealers.  One thing jumped on me - new C-class is in stock in good number - NOT A SINGLE unit with leather seat in multiple dealerships.  Even upscale C400.  All have MB-Tex.  BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don't get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point.  There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather.  I don't know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good?  I just find it hard to believe...  Not to mention that not a single one?"
3337,December 2014,carnaught,In my experience the MB-Tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic.  Tex may be actually more durable but I have no anecdotal or other proof of this.
3338,December 2014,markcincinnati,"The MB-Tex will eventually crack -- not the kind of cracks you can see in old leather, however."
3339,December 2014,roadburner,"I'm not against quality in-car audio systems or decent navigation systems. My issue is that today's buyers are usually distracted by the ""shiny things"" that are tangential at best to the overall driving experience."
3340,December 2014,roadburner,"That's also been my experience with BMW's ""Leatherette."" The"
3341,December 2014,flightnurse,"WOW, I thought you weren't going to ever step into a Caddy dealer? What made you change your mind?"
3342,December 2014,flightnurse,So it seems that Acura is having issues with the
3343,December 2014,robr2,"I have leatherette in my 2005 Passat.  It has worn like iron and does not show any signs of wear or cracking.  Given a choice, I would take leatherette over leather every time."
3344,December 2014,roadburner,"And speaking of vinyl, while I do not belong to the ""LPs are superior, CDs are garbage"" cult, I dug out the AR-XA turntable I bought from my uncle(for $75!) and set it up in the basement HTS. Now to buy a Shure M97xE cartridge and a few accessories..."
3345,December 2014,ab348,"Heh... I went down that road in 2007. I had all these crates full of vinyl records I had bought from the mid-70s until I finally bought a CD player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest. Yes, it sounds good, but I seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that I once had. Now it is all gathering dust again."
3346,December 2014,graphicguy,"FN....it's a long story.  Reader's Digest version, I got a deal I couldn't pass up.  Had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out.  Cadillac is really stepping it up.  CTS has turned into something I never would have expected.  They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing."
3347,December 2014,dino001,"I'm with Graphic on leather.  I drove several loaners with the ""ette"" and they did not feel that great.  Rough touch, dull color and of course smell.  All the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great legend so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you insist on real stuff.  Well, they obviously can get away with that.  Especially Benz.  I see BMWs have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend."
3348,December 2014,flightnurse,"While at the MB dealer we test drove a ML250 that had the fake stuff, at first I didn't know it was fake, it felt like leather, and the contrasting stitching really elevated the whole look."
3349,December 2014,brian125,Nothing beat the 1970's Chrysler Cordoba with the fine Corinthian  leather.
3350,December 2014,graphicguy,"FN...no issues.  Lots pf vehicles competing in this space (E series, 5 Series, A6, ets).  Someone will find what they're looking for."
3351,December 2014,flightnurse,I agree completely and the better the competition the better the cars...
3352,December 2014,billyperks4,Man-I am loving this 5 series-this is really a nice car- I hope I don't sound too carried away.
3353,December 2014,sweendogy,"Happy holidays- good to see the world of Ellps continues to drive on. The mentions of the IS250 and caddy cts - cads not talked of . I think the Lexi is an interesting looking car but as mentioned the drivetrain and cost for me it's a non-starter. The cts was car of the year - but poor gm they can't get out of own way when it comes to bad headlines. Caddy has a good car here but I would never own one (maybe lease) do to poorer resale values, some of which is due to continued recalls. This article from a website flight knows"
3354,December 2014,ab348,"Well, I just leased a 2014 ATS 2.0T AWD and am really impressed. It is an incredible car to drive and I love the looks. Got a great year-end deal. Happy."
3355,December 2014,stickguy,"was at the mall today (what kind of idiot goes to the cherry hill mall at 4:30 on a Saturday just before Christmas?  Oh yeah, me.  And a ton of other fools!).  They had a couple of cars parked in there.  One was a Q50 (white).  Not bad looking.  The other was a black Acura TLX.  a V6 FWD tech.  MSRP $40,150.  Sharp looking car with the espresso leather.  Still seems kind of pricey to me, but pretty well loaded.  Though if I was spending that much and getting the HP, would probably want the AWD to better manage it."
3356,December 2014,stickguy,"Also, was reading one of my car magazines, and they had a long term wrap up on their ATS with the 2.0 motor.  overall really liked it.  small back seat, but you have to know that going in!  a few nits I believe (cue?), but dynamically sounded really nice (power/handling/MPG)."

3373,December 2014,brian125,I find P21s carnauba wax just as good as Zaino's  wax   if not better. P21s has  less steps to wax. Goes on and off effortless. Makes dark looking vehicle look like a sheet of glass. Been using this wax for 20 years.

3406,November 2014,brian125,Both Q's  5 and 7  are nice.......... but pricey
3407,November 2014,ab348,They didn't look like one either.

3410,November 2014,flightnurse,"The least expensive Macan that Scottsdale Porsche has is $75K, that isn't a turbo model either.. So not too sure how competitive it really is with the Q5..."
3411,November 2014,brian125,"Audi has a 1500 dollar loyalty  bonus for owners of a Bmw , MB, Lexus  which I qualify for. Looks like BMW has a  2k incentive also.  This just might be a Dec.  to........ Remember"

3426,November 2014,markcincinnati,"Simply put, the SQ5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior Audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the SQ5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot."
3427,November 2014,stickguy,"isn't the Q5 interior (and cargo area) on the small side for the class?  I remember looking at them before we got the RDX, and I have it in my head that it seemed very tight in the back."
3428,November 2014,flightnurse,This is how I feel in regards to the Q5 TDI.... Gobs of torque that starts off so low and just pulls and pulls..

It looks like I will get over 45k miles out of the tire in each application. I will likely go with the Michelin  Pilot Sport A/S 3 when the Coopers wear out since the local tire shop I use no longer carries Cooper tires.

Of course, once I put th new sneaks on the XK, I traded for an AWD XF.  As I traded my newly Vredestein-shod '05 TL for the XK.

3441,November 2014,markcincinnati,sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really SHOULD be done.  I assume I am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires.  I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.
3442,November 2014,sweendogy,"Now in my second swap out and mark I agree it's not the best- I don't know the perfect date to do the swap- don't want to wait to long and hit a patch of ice on slicks or drive to long on the harder winters in decent mild weather. The cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. The goodyear a/s UHP I had on the G - they did the trick just fine. They def rode a little harsher then the standard G tires and were better in the sun- but the G on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non UHP - a/s. No perfect answer in this equation, unless you move to either Arizona or Alaska. I would go to Zona."

Then there are also some nice ELPS, too, but their luxury scope is often limited to couple of nice features. Ok machines, but not ELLPS.  Another part is base version vs. optioned.  Not just leather, but engine, sports suspension, or engine, will change the machine dramatically."
3470,October 2014,stickguy,"I actually looked back to the beginning of this thread (from 2002!).  I still think that the S4, 335i are a step up (middle level?).  The TLX, A4, 320/328, S60 still fit the profile for EL."

3472,October 2014,sweendogy,For those considering a Volvo or the new acura TLX -or those who would compare both-
3473,October 2014,stickguy,"well, those are 2 cars I certainly wouldn't be buying if I was planning to go drag racing!"
3474,October 2014,flightnurse,"Interesting video, Rick and I started the look for his SUV, and we went to the Volvo dealer and drove a XC60 with the E-Drive engine, this is a Super and Turbo Charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. This sweetens the deal a lot.."
3475,October 2014,markcincinnati,I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point?  Things have changed in 12 years.
3476,October 2014,stickguy,"If you are looking at an x3 and xc90, should look at Acura RDX. Instead to be comparable."
3477,October 2014,flightnurse,"Mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the 335i 300hp and torque, with the MPPK and MPE you are looking at 335-340hp easily and BMW is very conservative with their HP rating.  The current M3/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the M4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if Audi where to bring a RS4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a V8, but from a V6."
3478,October 2014,markcincinnati,"Flight -- even with the 333HP my S4 claims to have (which Motor Trend says is an understatement), I can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks."

Say, coming from something like my 2007 Volvo (aka the ""putt putt mobile"") the 320 is still a seriously nice car.  Is it the highest end?  No, but it is cheaper."

3482,October 2014,brian125,Not to mention a very sharp looking vehicle. When this model can go further without a charge I may entertain buying one. I have been  seeing more  Tesla's  on the road this past year here in the  NY area.  The Telsa  S is not   cheap either at almost 80k.  Still not sure  if  its  worth the money even if you  could afford one.
3483,October 2014,sweendogy,
3484,October 2014,brian125,I do agree with you about  up here in the North East.  RWD is terrible in winter months   especially when you consider dropping this kind of coin. If you can afford to take it out of the garage for some pleasure driving 8 months out of the year that's  fine.   Last I looked the driving range was under 300 miles. That to me is unacceptable to travel around with a vehicle. Local driving this car is fine. I drive from  NY to Myrtle beach  2 sometimes 3x a year. The Tesla  wouldn't  make it to  M.D without stopping to charge up................  LOL.

3487,October 2014,Mr_Shiftright,"I priced out a fully optioned maximum, all you can buy Tesla during a test drive and it came out to just over $130,000.  Maybe ""entry-level"" for the 1% ?"
3488,October 2014,sweendogy,
3489,October 2014,Mr_Shiftright,"Hmmm...I don't think the Tesla is worth $130K at least not the current model. It's maybe worth the $75K level. Even the new ""entry-level"" C class Mercedes fully equipped, comes in at $62,000 and it's a match for the Tesla S at the moment, IMO--it even has more tech."
3490,October 2014,stickguy,I was cruising the used car listings and the local Ford dealer has a used Tesla on their site (pictures showing it in the showroom).  No price listed though.
3491,October 2014,roadburner,"As the Brits would say, I had a bit of a play with a Model S while driving a new 2015  X6 at the truck's international launch in South Carolina. The Tesla was pretty quick, but it seemed to slow and fall back the longer we ""played""- don't know if that was due to the driver, the batteries, or some other issue."
3492,October 2014,sweendogy,"""IMO--it even has more tech."" I guess that depends what ""tech"" is important. Tesla could be considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever- from production to completion. It's overpriced for sure - and maybe it shouldn't be a comp to the s class- but it's got plenty of tech --maybe not the best radio - any 4 door sedan that can get to 60 in 3.2 seconds and now has an auto pilot feature is pretty cool- oh and it fits 7 people and yes doesn't need gas or oil change."

3494,October 2014,Mr_Shiftright,"It might have ""tech"" but not the latest tech. It's really last year's cellphone already. There's no lane avoidance tech, no collision avoidance tech, no heads up display, no blind spot technology. You can have some of these features in a GMC Yukon and all of them in just about any luxury sedan built for 2015."

3500,October 2014,Mr_Shiftright,"True, but Tesla didn't have to re-invent the wheel and go back to 1896. . It was all out there waiting for them.  This is the Auto Industry 2015, not 1955. You have to be on top of your game every minute, because your competition is clever, fierce and relentless."

3503,October 2014,sweendogy,"Back on topic- In anti tesla style - I'm amazed how bad Infiniti has stubbed of late. For 2013 the ""g"" was retired but late in 2013 they announced they would keep the car and g label for another year and sold in 2014 a 2013 G as a new car. They never produced a 2014 G or Q? but for 2015 the old G will become they new Q40."
3504,October 2014,markcincinnati,"The new TLX with SH-AWD ought to be the IT car right now in this class (and maybe on this forum). Content-wise, this (and from an actual cost, not MSRP basis, the Q50, too) ought to be setting the world on fire sales-wise."
3505,October 2014,stickguy,"I recall reading somewhere recently that it is selling well, at least relative to what it replaced!  And have seen some good reports. As always, have to filter the magazine stuff to get to what real people care about.  And no, nit everyone here represents the ""average buyer"" for one of these (the same folks that by 320is and don't order the big engine sport pack models)."
3506,October 2014,stickguy,"Also, I kept meaning to question what gets counted here. To me, your S4 is not an ELLPS.  That would be an A4, or a 328i. S4 to me us another class, along with the M3."
3507,September 2014,graphicguy,"One of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option.  My former S4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge.  I think my 335i had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra.  My TL's?  No extra charge.  And, Acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better."
3508,September 2014,qbrozen,"I noticed Mazda is charging $600 for metallic paint on the mazda2, so its definitely not limited to luxo cars anymore."
3509,September 2014,stickguy,"The only paint charge I saw at Mazda was $300 extra for the flashy red.  If the are doing it on the 2, probably why you can see them advertised so cheap."
3510,September 2014,robr2,Actually it's $200 and it's for the white pearl mica.
3511,September 2014,ab348,GM is doing this now too. Their nicer colors like White Diamond Tricoat and Crystal Red Tintcoat are significantly more money - I believe $1200 on a Cadillac here in Canada.
3512,September 2014,stickguy,"Some of those I think are actually special process paint, so probably actually cost more to do."
3513,September 2014,flightnurse,"Regarding the vette, GM has stopped selling them as there are a couple of safety related recalls. I like the new C7, but why can't GM get it right when it comes to reducing the amount of recalls."
3514,September 2014,robr2,"Every manufacturer now errs on the conservative side when it comes to recalls, stop sales, et al."
3515,September 2014,tlong,"No, I haven't taken a look at the TLX yet. I'm leaning toward wanting a smaller car, however. My TL is a bit bigger than I'd like."
3516,September 2014,qbrozen,
3517,September 2014,cdnpinhead,"Charging extra for ""special"" paint colours is much like the high-end hotels charging an extra $10 per night for internet while Super 8 (and nearly everyone else) includes it in the nightly rate.  If you complain or feel you're getting screwed, you're not worthy."
3518,September 2014,flightnurse,"Yes, of course, however, I was just pointing out that the C7 has been plagued with problems, first blown engines (Car and Drivers C7) as well as others, these are on early C7, as well as auto transmission problems and now safety recalls which GM pulled the sales of them."
3519,September 2014,graphicguy,FN.....didn't know that about the 'vette.  My best friend just ordered a '15 convertible a few weeks ago.  I wonder if he knows production is held up?  He said he expected it by early-mid- October.
3520,September 2014,flightnurse,"Its been interesting following C&D online, they talk about the issues they have been having with their long term C7, not a good thing to have a blown engine... I'm fully aware of issues that manufacture have, but GM has been plagued with them for years..."
3521,September 2014,roadburner,And not just on high end cars either- Mazda and Ford charge extra for certain colors.
3522,September 2014,sweendogy,"I read the same article and it was overall positive on the vette- the other problems a punctured tire and a chipped windshield, sure the blown engine - they seem happy - as the header reads ""Our Corvette blew an engine but we still love it."""

Other than the body shop ""coolant hose"" debacle, it has been flawless and perfect mechanically.  No breakdowns, no problems, no issues."
3526,September 2014,flightnurse,"The ""upgraded sound system"" is only speakers and amp, not head unit. I also think the reason for not supporting FLAC has to be the HD space. Since the files would be too large."
3527,October 2014,sweendogy,"I have the b&o and recently had a 2015 loaner a4 non- b&o and found the stock radio fine but nothing special, it couldn't stream from my iphone.  I like the b&o as I'm usually listen to Rihanna and she sounds pretty good, I listen to a lot of streaming talk radio as well --For a real treat in sound I throw it in dynamic mode/ and hammer down- the artificial sound coming thru the car is all I need."
3528,October 2014,tlong,The question is can you hear the difference in sound quality between a high bitrate MP3 and FLAC when in a car moving down a road and generating its own noise? I would be interested in somebody running a blind test to see if and how many people could tell the difference.
3529,October 2014,flightnurse,"I think I answered that, and the answer is no, well unless you add about 200 lbs of sound deadening to the car. People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin.  This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD. Car audio in cars today are very good, for me, I think the Mark Levinson system in the Lexus LS460 is one of the best."
3530,October 2014,sweendogy,The good news people the mark lev is awesome - bad news is its in an 80k msrp dollar sedan the size of Texas- more good news 10k off right now according to truecar.  How's the camry systems?  How's the system in the 320? I'm ok with the b&o from audi- just like I was ok with the bose from Infiniti - good radios - better the base but not like sitting in a movie theater or an Lexus.
3531,October 2014,flightnurse,"In the 3 series there are two type of Sound Systems, Standard and Harmon Kardon (upgrade.) So in the 320 I have to standard sound system, however I have improved it slightly, I upgraded the amp and made the ""sub's"" under the seats more of a mid bass then ""sub's"" so over all the sound has improved. There is a thread on Bimmerfest about upgrading the standard sound system by upgrading the amp, for $45 was able to buy the adapter and a friend had the amp I did (he gave it to me.) 55 minutes of my time and I used the setting that people have recommended. Oveall, much improved, but nothing close to the B&O in the S4, or Lexus."

3534,October 2014,sweendogy,"Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days.  With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure.  Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think."
3535,October 2014,markcincinnati,"Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP.  Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there.  For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?"

3543,September 2014,graphicguy,"Yeah....probably right, Kirstie.  Fact is, I was looking at my TL's value on my iPad the last time I got an oil change.  My sales guy happens by, greets me, looks at my iPad to see I'm looking at trade value and invoice numbers on the TLX.  He laughs and said, "".....TLX is too new for a GG type deal.  I'll call you in 6 more months, though.  We van hammer something then when the supply catches up with demand."""
3544,September 2014,Michaell,And yet there is someone in another thread who would absolutely not consider the new TLX because of the commercial Acura created for it.
3545,September 2014,ab348,"In fairness, I am seeing a number of non-professional drive reports from interested parties/potential buyers that are not at all positive, so that weighs heavily against it too. Could Acura have badly missed the mark?"

3551,September 2014,Michaell,Not according to my wife I don't.....
3552,September 2014,graphicguy,"AB.....from the reviews I've seen, the TLX is been rated from positive, to very positive.  You're going to have the ""Fast and Furious"" crowd that laments the omission of ground effects, ""go fast"" spoilers, etc.  They still want the ""blaaaaaat""  exhaust cans that you won't get on a TLX.  Matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the TLX."
3553,September 2014,stickguy,"GG, those are all the reasons it is attractive to me!"
3554,September 2014,qbrozen,LOL that you even looked! haha.
3555,September 2014,sweendogy,
3556,September 2014,stickguy,"The TL I think did take a hit from bad styling.  The RL though to me looks just fine.  Certainly not exciting or edgy, but conservative and reasonably attractive.  Definitely not ugly though.  RL was too expensive though, which hurt."
3557,September 2014,sweendogy,
3558,September 2014,flightnurse,"The RL lacks in looks, there is nothing standout about it, it doesn't say Q-Ship, the RL is the top sedan for Acura and it doesn't say that, very understated.."
3559,September 2014,benjaminh,"The base TLX is very nicely equipped for $31k. I'm tempted to see if in 6-10 months good discounts are available....Otherwise, I'll probably go with the Accord again."
3560,September 2014,sweendogy,
3561,September 2014,benjaminh,"Although the TLX is based on the Accord, they actually did several significant structural upgrades, included use of even higher grades of steel. Here's some stuff from the Acura press release about that:"
3562,September 2014,stickguy,"OK, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the TLX in person (did not drive, will do that when I take my TL in for an oil change soon)."
3563,September 2014,stickguy,"oh, and as I typed this, saw about 3-4 different ads for the TLX on the Jets game.  So Acura is making a push for selling this car.  I think it will do well, assuming it drives as well as the car shows (particularly the interior and feature content)."
3564,September 2014,sweendogy,"Jets fans are huge target for acura, always has been that way- you go 10 seconds into Long Island and you are bound to find an acura. Just like today's game they are very promising but when it matters they can't score- very similar to Hondas acura but maybe this year will be different."
3565,September 2014,tlong,I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.
3566,September 2014,circlew,"TLong, did you try the TLX yet?  I haven't had interest in the TL since your series was destroyed by the last gen TL but I'd like to get your take to compare to the '05 you have."

They were recently bought by google (a yr ago)- it uses real time driver info from users and the reporting is via users. Gives info on traffic, weather, potholes and best of all Cop locations. It reroutes on the fly- like if there is an accident 2 exits away it will tell me to get off and take service streets - wicked smart.  As I sit here there are 7500 users near by with 2300 reports this am, and 50 million worldwide users according to forbes."

Real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. Also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not Ellps. And at the bargain price of 35k really?  And done"

4623,November 2013,robr2,What you are looking at is the user interface.  What I was talking about was the technology that delivers that user interface.  That life is about 30 months.
4624,November 2013,markcincinnati,"If you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so?"
4625,November 2013,cdnpinhead,"that a sporty car had a taut suspension that was cleverly designed to allow the vehicle to go around corners like it was ""on rails.""  It had a manual transmission that was fun to use.  It might have had some kind of big-boy engine that provided ~ 6 second 0-60 runs, but that wasn't necessary by any means.  It had some kind of audio system that provided entertainment on straight roads (and otherwise, but it didn't matter so much then)."

4627,November 2013,dino001,"I have no problem woth changing tech as long as the old one still works at least for a while.  Three years is too short, something like six may be acceptable, especially at prices charged by both Apple and BMW.  I do not accept premise that perfectly functioning $200 product should be tossed out so quickly for sake of new tech that does the same thing, like playing same music files at same quality.  BTW, my Nano has up to date OS, which means it is the new 328 interface not accepting it."
4628,November 2013,graphicguy,"I'm not so sure it's obsolescence, per se.  But, I do think that the electronics aren't fully developed in cars to accept what has been a dizzying expansion of chips, PCBs, computers and software used to operate cars."
4629,November 2013,sweendogy,"That is the question? After a great run in the G- yes it's been 7 model years and 38k miles - my G finally gave me some trouble- the drivetrain belt (alternator belt?) shredded on the highway a few miles from work- was able to limp the car into the lot and had it towed to dealer for the 200bux repair. Made me think time for an upgrade? But then again it was only 200 bux to fix, but could this be the beginning of other more major issues to happen...I've never owned a car out of warrantee before- made me worry. Checked out the new q in the dealership, nice looking rig but the consumer reports article still rates the g higher.  Plus they are not cheap and few deals around this far. 2 other options a cpo 335x (pre new body) or a cpo Audi s4. Both have great warranties - both great performers - but hearing the recent take on s4 issues has me worried, along with costs of course.  Could wait a year and do the s3, sure is a looker - prob tops out around 50k - has enuf hp to an low end grunt- but can I wait- love hearing the experience thou from the masses."

4632,November 2013,nyccarguy,"Sorry to here about your recent trouble with the G.  Glad to hear you were able to make it off the highway to safety & get the car towed to the dealer OK.  All things considered, $200 isn't that bad of a repair bill at all."

4634,November 2013,leoblue,"As far as technology advancement is concerned, I still don't understand why my $2100 NAV option on my 2013 BMW 328 doesn't speak out the name of the streets (text-to-speech) while my 5 years old $200 Garmin has been doing it for 5 years."

In fairness, I haven't driven the new CTS, nor the new E350.  I drove a 535i during the BMW drive event.  And, I agree that it feels like a ponderous brick on the road (except, I too like the 3.0 Turbo motor, but more in a 3 series than the bigger, heavier 5)."

4641,November 2013,andres3,"Working on 300 miles thus far.  Taking it easy so far, but the car is simply in one word to summarize ""impeccable."""
4642,November 2013,markcincinnati,"Andres3 -- wait until you get over 1,000 miles on the OD; at that mileage the power improves and the fuel consumption drops.  I did notice a slight decrease in the oil level (on the MMI screen), but the indicator still says ""OK."""
4643,December 2013,flightnurse,"So I haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in Tucson.  On my trips down and back, I have been averaging 36 MPG, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. The traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. Before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go."

4656,November 2013,graphicguy,"FN....just drove down to Lexington this a.m. in the A6.  It's a big car, obviously.  But, the 4 cyl turbo does indeed do well in ""normal"" driving.  I was quite surprised the amount of ""zing"" it has passing on the interstate.  If it were mine, I would have to ""chip"" it, though."
4657,November 2013,flightnurse,"Graphic, this is how manufactures are playing the displacement game, with the turbo engine, allow the engine to make good amount of power down low to ""fool"" people into thinking it has more then advertise, also the 8 spd transmission does not hurt either."

What's also strange, the glass window in the gate (yes, similar feature to those on bog SUVs) would not open.  As it turned, the dealer is replacing both latch assemblies, gate and glass window.  I'm sure it's one of those classic electrical motor things, or perhaps even electronic control module.

I realize that the fixes are cheap(warranty) but time is also money.  I had a 10 year old Infiniti that never had a bulb or a motor fixed or replaced.  I currently have a 10 year old Toyota pickup that also has never had a bulb or motor fixed or replaced.  We also have a 6 year old with Mazda that has never had  a motor fixed or replaced and it just went over 103k miles.

4757,October 2013,dino001,"I know my car was made specifically in Munich.  Not South Africa, not North America.  One failure does not make a pattern, so we will see how that works.  My guess that certain part suppliers are local, but others may be global.  If a part is small and easy to ship large distances  in large quantities, but requires some specific manufacturing (electric motors, electronic modules, etc.), there is no reason to split suppliers.  Bulky  items, easy to spec and manufacture (seats, liners, interior, sheetmetal) , a different story."
4758,October 2013,dino001,"I don't think it's the Eastern Europe issue.  Most electronics today are made in East Asia or Eastern Europe, it is all controlled by handfull of companies.  I think it's more about attitude and cost controls.  Relays, electrical items have certain lifetime designed into them (say X hours).  One rated for half of those hours can cost one tenth of the price - and it looks just the same.  It becomes irresistible for them to try, especially that chances are, majority will work for much longer.   That rating may come from statistical sampling that certain percentage will meet the time criteria and to achieve same percentage of the the longer time, manufacturing process would have to be redesigned, making part that much more expensive.  Cost-benefit for manufacturer becomes such that it's cheaper to deal with higher percentage repairs than pay for one that lasts.  Why Germans do that and Japanese stick to better quality?  This may have to do with cost of labor.  There is only so much you can do to add efficiency.  German labor is simply most expensive, not just due to wages, but also additional costs, from social security, to taxes, to benefits.  Only so much can be paid out of customer's money, before they refuse."

4761,October 2013,dino001,"I had same thing and asked about it (it was even showing 2 years from first oil change date).  They told me the date is based not on paid schedule (which is 12 months), but on ""latest"" the car should come in the dealership in case somebody drives very low miles.  You still can/should come at 12 months, even if the mileage is not up yet and they'll pay.  They told me it just has to be at least 12 months plus 1 day.  The April date seems just to latests to maintain your engine warranty."
4762,October 2013,nyccarguy,It is the mileage or 1 year.  You are correct.
4763,October 2013,nyccarguy,Flight nurse - I'd get that checked out.  I had a brand new 328xi (60 miles) & saw it needed service @ 10K.
4764,October 2013,dino001,"You actually can go more than 1 year between oil changes, according to my guy.  The car has the programing do-dad that anticipates next service depending on driving.  I don't think synthetic oil gets old, not in one or two years, anyway, so one could drive on it.  As I recall, my then new car had similar cutoff date as FN's, 18 months, when car was new and then it switched to 2 years after the first oil change.   However, BMW will pay every 12 months, so why not do it?"
4765,October 2013,robr2,
4766,October 2013,m6user,"Since the owner's manual says max of 1 yr or by the oil monitor whichever comes first, I'll follow that schedule so I don't have to worry about any sort of warranty problem down the road.  My oil monitor had just dropped to the 30% oil life left  when it hit one year.  The power train has 6 yr warranty so I want to maintain that with no questions asked."
4767,October 2013,graphicguy,alltorque...I agree.  The BMW oil change intervals is probably a function of the dealer revenue stream than it is with the oil breaking down (BMW uses synth oil).
4768,October 2013,dino001,"I don't know - these 2.0 turbos are still only 3 years in service, it is possible that they got some statistically significant results prompting them to shorten the mileage between changes.  It wouldn't be visible from an average person's view (his nearest dealer's garage), as not many of those engines reached 100K miles yet, but from corporate view they might be seing emerging patterns for those subsamples of the long mileage engines across the world.  Just saying, it's possible."
4769,October 2013,dino001,"I think is was around early to mid 2000s.  There was definitely a coincidence between increasing the period and instituting ""free"" maintenance."
4770,October 2013,markcincinnati,"Another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease:  the amount of oil that the European cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a Japanese ""premium"" car requires."
4771,October 2013,graphicguy,"I know I had a late '80s 325i (first BMW) and an early '00s 330i, in addition to the E92 coupe I had.  The last one was the only one I remember having free 4 year maintenance.  So, you're probably right Dino."
4772,October 2013,m6user,"""Another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease: the amount of oil that the European cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a Japanese ""premium"" car requires."""
4773,October 2013,dino001,"Not to pick on your word choice, but I would call German car schedule ""aggressive"" and Infiniti's ""extremely conservative"".  Now to answer your question:  Infiniti dealers use old-school mineral oil on those still fairly modern engines.  For those not to sludge, I suspect you need to have keep this oil new and change it often.  I guess the pact is come often, pay small entrance fee (for the oil change) and we will find four opportunities per year to pick your pocket on something else we will ""find"" or invent.  I feel that if Infiniti suddenly changed the schedule to once per year good quality synthetic, the dealers would lose all those revenue upsell opportunities."
4774,October 2013,m6user,"When I used the word ""aggressive"" I was referring to the aggressive assault on one's wallet so I used the word correctly but didn't use my turn signals to indicate the direction I was coming from.   But when someone says they have THE answer to my question and then says ""I suspect"", ""I guess"" and ""I feel"" I have to wonder about their word choice as well.  But that doesn't change the fact that I would tend to agree with everything you've said."
4775,October 2013,dino001,"Whoa!  Now you're picking on my words.  OK, here it is: my choice of words was very careful to precisely express that I do not have a real knowledge, just conjecture and constructed narrative.  However, I should have not written that's ""to answer your question"", but rather ""to speculate"" or something like that."
4776,October 2013,m6user,"Whoa, what?  I can't question but you can?  Yeah, you should have wrote something like ""I think I have the answer to your question""  You made it sound like you are the authority on Infiniti oil change schedules and then went on with your answer which is a WAG at best."
4777,October 2013,dino001,"Just playing.  For the record:  I am NOT an Infiniti authority, nor any other brand."
4778,October 2013,Kirstie_H,This is just getting silly.  Let's get rid of the sarcasm and hostility.  I'm about in a bad enough mood between this discussion and another one to start removing posting privileges without any notice.
4779,October 2013,kyfdx,Our Infiniti doesn't use synthetic.....
4780,October 2013,m6user,Can't any car use synthetic if you want to?
4781,October 2013,kyfdx,Yes.. but recommended intervals are based on the oil it comes with...   which was my only point..
4782,October 2013,jeffm5,"Last July I bought a 2013 S60 T5.  I was shocked to find out that the oil change intervals were 1 yr. or 10,000 miles, with synthetic oil, of course.  I've been a 3,000 to 4,000 mile oil change type guy, but have never used synthetic oil.  Volvo provides the first 5 oil changes, per their schedule, at their expense.  So when I took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought I was nuts.  Someone else who I consider knowledgeable in this area said I'm wasting money and resources.  I did have the oil changed again at 10,000 miles, free.  I've recently come to the conclusion that I will have the oil changed at every 10,000 miles.  I guess I'll find out in 5 yrs. or more as to whether this was sound advice."
4783,October 2013,graphicguy,"Jeff...with synthetic, you should be good.  Of course, engines are pretty complex, that operate at extreme temps, both cold and hot, dirty, greasy, dusty, etc.  So, something can always go wrong.  My guess is, the oil change intervals will not be the culprit, though."
4784,October 2013,robr2,
4785,October 2013,dino001,
4786,October 2013,alltorque,"Volvo S60 T5 in Europe is oil change at 18,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first. This assumes correct viscosity and spec. Engines are same on both continents. Volvo oil specs are universal I believe, (SAE 0w-30, ACEA A5/B5), so.................it's all to do with greed and nothing to do with oil quality or engine life.  10,000 mile changes in Europe would be cause for rioting in the streets. Even using ACEA A1/B1 poverty spec it's 12,000 miles. Same old same old."
4787,October 2013,dino001,"I agree, but there is another side of this.  It is much easier to get a warranty honored in the US than in Europe, not just with cars, anything manufactured.  The manufacturers find many inventive ways to walk away from their obligations with impunity over there.  I found there is also much more goodwill here as well (major repairs after warranty with manufacturer's cost participation).  One can say the goodwill is ""prepaid"" in those short intervals."
4788,October 2013,markcincinnati,"It seems that Audi, BMW and soon Volvo (among other Euro brands) are quickly becoming car companies that motivate virtually all of their cars with some form of a forced induction engine. Turbo charging seems to be the go-to forced induction technology.  Audi and Mercedes use superchargers in some applications -- but the majority of the Euro brands (and also starting to show up in non-Euro brands, to be sure) are not naturally aspirated any more."
4789,October 2013,robr2,I believe one might see a shorter oil change interval on turbo engines.  I wonder how the oil sensor gizmo on the current BMW turbos schedules it?
4790,October 2013,cdnpinhead,"is ingrained in a truck owner's (doesn't apply to company drivers) daily routine:  let it warm up before going full-throttle and, much more importantly, let it and the cooling (oil & water) systems stabilize before shutting the engine down.  I let the EGT drop to300 degrees or lower before I shut down (and it often took 2 - 5 minutes) -- prevents coking, among other things.  It's not often that a mechanical engineer ends up being a truck driver, but when it happens things can be learned."
4791,October 2013,graphicguy,cdn...it will indeed be interesting to see what the recommended fluid change intervals will be with turbos and super chargers in more and more engines...especially the brands with longer warranties.
4792,October 2013,alltorque,"Sorry, cannot agree with your statement re warranty in Europe.  Can't talk about engines as I don't know anyone who's ever had a failure. However when my '06 Volvo S60, (see above), was annual-serviced 2 weeks ago the Volvo dealer updated the engine management software FOC and checked to see if there were any reported extra safety checks flagged by Volvo, (there weren't). Standard, no hassle servicing."
4793,October 2013,alltorque,"Read my above post ref Volvo S60 turbodiesel oil changes. Whilst (relatively) small turbo engines may be fairly new to USA, at least in volume terms, they have been around in Europe and Japan for quite some time; particularly the diesel variety. Oil change intervals of 18,000 to 20,000 miles are not at all unusual from the major manufacturers and these engines seem to go on forever. Of course, abused turbos, (i.e. not allowing a cooling-down period. After a period of high revs a gentle amble around urban roads of 2 - 3 miles will suffice or a 2 min+ idle), will fail sooner than is considered normal."
4794,October 2013,dino001,"I guess it may vary from region to region.  Eastern Europe seems to be still ""customer service challenged"", at least Poland is.  Basically any kind of warranty work used to be a torture there, authorized service stations are still not reliable source of quality work (it's a crap shoot),  press is full of reports of denied warranties under most bizzarre pretences, or smallest customer infractions.  It is getting better, bad publicity and social media are putting more and more pressure.  I would not be surprised if Western Europe, having much longer and better established consumer rights and customer service, was much better."
4795,October 2013,graphicguy,I think I'll stick with the S4....not even close....
4796,October 2013,qbrozen,"well, the S3 is going to be the competitor, right?"

4800,October 2013,Kirstie_H,"My S.O.'s company has a deal with National, and he likes that (now that he's used to it) because if you're a frequent renter, you get to pick your vehicle.  I think getting to drive a variety of cars is the only thing keeping him from getting the ""new car bug"" at home!    They used to be with Hertz, and that was great for the ""I don't have to talk to anyone"" feature - just your name on the board, go to the slot, and your car is there with keys in it, ready to leave."
4801,October 2013,andres3,I remember when Enterprise told me getting an Accord with a V6 would probably be a Premium level 2 car rental equivalent.  It was then I knew that the categories rental car companies named don't make much sense in real life.
4802,October 2013,graphicguy,"Yeah...the whole ""We try harder"" ad campaign for Avis really doesn't fit them any more.  It should be more like ""We don't care""."

4812,October 2013,andres3,"Agreed; Audi allows you to pick ala cart items from the ""PRESTIGE"" package with the ""Premium Plus"" package, therefore making the PRESTIGE package pointless unless you like every item it includes."
4813,October 2013,flightnurse,"I don't want to high jack a thread, but for the company I work for we have a contract with all the rental companies, and I continue to  always go back to National. I like that I can go to any car under the awning's and take it without a problem. Lately there has been some interesting cars, I just had a Volvo XC60, as well as S60.  I average  60-75 rentals a year and never had a problem with National, that I can not say with Hertz or Avis."

4816,October 2013,markcincinnati,"I've now spent a bit of time ""initializing"" the S4's MMI system parameters -- including Audi Connect (free for 6-months).  In terms of ease of use, the MMI user interface remains super easy, one could argue it is almost intuitive.  What I do notice, this time, in comparison to my 2009 A4 Prestige, is that there seems to be more that can be configured via the MMI.  I had to chuckle when I pressed the CAR button and was presented with the ability to set my INDIVIDUAL preferences and one of them pertained to the engine/exhaust sound: ""Comfort,"" ""Auto,"" or ""Dynamic."" This option must be there simply ""because they could.""  I guess when your car stickers at north of $56K, you need to be able to rule your domain, so to speak."
4817,October 2013,graphicguy,"Mark...glad you're enjoying the S4.  I agree with everything you say.  The Audi connect wasn't worth it to me, either.  In addition, during the trial, it was painfully slow."
4818,October 2013,dino001,"Just attended my dealer's model introduction event.  Not a very good one - they simply grabed first available salesman and gave me their standard test drive.  The only difference between the ""event"" and standard day at the office was they had vehicles lined up and ready, so no time lost in searching.  And fancy appetizers, and small gift.  Not really comparable to those manufacturer's events."
4819,October 2013,dino001,"Seems they are recognizing their prices went bonkers.  There seem to be ongoing cash incentive for a few months now, they call it option allowance.  It even applies to newly released 2014 versions, like diesel, or GT.  They can call it whatever, bottom line they used to have cash incentives only during model switchovers, seems now it's on everything.  They should be careful, as it's very difficult to turn off cash incentive mill.  They may be thinking it's better to give people a deal than lower price, but I don't know.  Brand dilution is usually more pronounced when sold on X off basis than when retail price goes down.  Anyway, I predict free leather may come much sooner than on previous platform."
4820,October 2013,graphicguy,"dino....BMW has always seemed to be more focused on leasing.  As such, they've often subidized their leases pretty heavily."
4821,October 2013,markcincinnati,"Well take a look at the new Cadillac CTS Vsport pricing -- $59K+ base, $60K+ nicely equipped."
4822,October 2013,dino001,"Yeah, I know.  I don't fit that crowd.  Even if I bought things with short term in mind, I never found a lease I liked - at least so far.  It was mostly because those models I got DID NOT have as good lease incentives, as those volume models.  Converted money factors were higher than purchase interest rates, even before rolling in lease fees, and residual is only slightly inflated,  which was the case for my current wagon.  Basically the deal would have been nothing to write home about, so why would I lease?  My previous cars were Subarus and those guys don't inflate residuals at all - in fact STI I bought in 2008 had a very bad residual when compared with what I could actually sell it for after three years.  But 2011/2012 was abnormal, as tsunami crippled the Subaru's supply and inflated the their used car prices, which I think is the case even until today."
4823,October 2013,dino001,
4824,October 2013,graphicguy,FN...any further impressions of your 320i?
4825,October 2013,dino001,"I just discovered something that does not make me feel that great.  BMW changed their paid maintenance period for new cars to 12K miles/12 months, from previously 16K miles/12 months.  This means they either had too much resistance from their dealer base (this would not be such a big problem), or discovered that the oil simply doesn't last as they originally thought/claimed (this obviously is a big issue).  What about existing customers, those who bought in last few years and sticked to the computer recommended schedule?  I'm not very happy.  Seems like those who warned about this being an issue are now validated.  The only consolation I can think of is that my commute is at least 75%  highway, if not more and my engine is naturally aspirated vs. current BMW lineup is all turbocharged.  From my previous turbo owning times (had two Subarus with such engines), I know they tend to go through oil faster than naturally aspirated engines (turbos spin at 5-10 times engine spin).  I may be OK long term and no damage done, but it does not make me happy to think BMW was either too cheap or too arrogant in thinking that they can get away with those long periods."
4826,October 2013,alltorque,Would be very surprised if this was an oil-capability issue.  It is almost certainly a dealer/revenue-driven issue.

4829,October 2013,stickguy,"I think the AWD TL is the same as the RDX and they add in rear end diff fluid changes that the FWD version obviously does not need, and they are every couple of years."
4830,October 2013,billyperksii,"Thats exactly what I did- i bought my own (parts) and I will take to my mechanic for istallation, air filter, oil and filter change and maybe rear diff (dont think its needed at 24K)."
4831,October 2013,sichin2000,"If cross shopping was considered, I wonder if MB execs were sitting around pissed at blatant cloning (Genesis) and said lets build a sub-$30k car that's a better looking Sonata and see how Hyundai likes that."
4832,October 2013,markcincinnati,"I don't know if I posted that my wife ordered a 2014 Q5 3.0T P+ with the sport interior, nav, B&O, blind spot monitoring, etc.  Thing is, as is her ""policy"" we test drive the crap outta anything she is even remotely serious about.

4833,October 2013,sichin2000,Congrats!
4834,October 2013,markcincinnati,"I believe you are right.  When I started out, pre Audi Club discount, the dealer offered 5% off.  The ACNA certificate bumped it up to 6%.  The dealer discounted the Q5 MORE than 6%, so the ACNA discount wasn't the best deal."
4835,October 2013,carnaught,"Congrats on these cars.  Great choices, great colors.  I've always liked the white/red leather combo since (gulp) the 70's.  Either this or the black with red, I think are among the nicest.  The great thing about a red interior is that it isn't drab like black or light beige interiors. It's also easy to keep clean and every time you get in the car, it really pops and you'll be energized. (Can you tell I like red?)  Anyhow, good luck, and keep us apprised."

4838,October 2013,tifighter,"The A12 does not include the rear diff; that is a 6 in Acura-speak. A12 should be oil change, filter chg, pollen filter and tire rotation."

4850,October 2013,markcincinnati,"The situation with the TL is that I have 10 months left on the lease.  At the lease's conclusion, my mileage situation means I would owe about $5,000 to walk away from Acura.  Acura, unlike Infiniti, doesn't allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount.  My wife bought 18K miles per year on her lease, I couldn't do that."

4881,October 2013,robr2,"This vehicle - like the 320/325 - are offered to meet a price point.  Notice that all the advertising on the CLA is targeted to the price.  Heck, you can lease one for $349 a month with $3600 down."
4882,October 2013,dino001,"If you want 320 without maintenance, make sure you don't get sports line.  Its summer tires will go at 20-25K, other lines have all-seasons, which may last the whole lease, but they may go around 30K-35K, just before you turn it it.  You may get away with skipping alignment for three years, I guess, especially if you don't need to change tires before the lease is up."
4883,October 2013,fedlawman,I dont think FWD will hurt sales.

I think they just sell their software, and offer a bit of support, but we want more than a sort of box-package plan."
4888,September 2013,dino001,"Would be nice if that was gone.  Another thing I really miss is a ""future models"" section that old Edmunds used to have.  It always had a newest updates of the state of the knowledge about future models, sometimes not entirely accurate, because it was based on available (inclomplete) data and a little speculation/conjecture, but it was a good source of what was likely coming down the pike.  I'm wondering why it was removed.  Too hard to maintain and not enough interest?"
4889,September 2013,nyccarguy,I agree with you sweendogy about the current G37X being a fantastic value.  A friend of mine was just in an Infiniti dealership this afternoon.  They offered to lease him a 2013 G37X (no navigation) for 24 months with absolutely $0 down for $325 per month (including 6.35% tax).  That's a deal!
4890,September 2013,Kirstie_H,"Yes, and yes.  However, again... the new platform has more flexibility and we hope to see more ""future models"" talk there, and potentially create more future model talk.  If you mention your interest in a Future Models category over on the discussion I linked to, it'll be noticed."

Of course, as most of users will not be able to service their cars online, they still have to have actual service centers. Provided that most of us still have to test-drive the car before the purchase, I guess that this also involves dealerships. Therefore, I believe that the best way for you to find your information is at"

4895,September 2013,markcincinnati,"Although I had read the R&T comparison on-line, my physical magazine arrived in the mail yesterday (Monday 9/23) -- and I re-read the Q50 v ATS v 335 v IS 350 F-Sport article.  I assume you could infer that I am carrying Infiniti's water, but the article did make a comment that even the loser (or 3rd finisher) in the bunch was a ""nice car."""
4896,September 2013,andres3,"Your findings on the S4 are the same as mine.  Which is why I ordered one lightly optioned and got the dealer to agree to take only 50K out of my bank accounts (don't worry, CA will take about 5K more before it's all said and done."
4897,September 2013,graphicguy,"Mark...you'll get not rebuttal from me regarding the S4.  Drop the ""pearlescent"" paint, the hi-zoot seats, and the ""whatzatstuff"" trim, and you should be able to make a case for a low $50-ish check with your dealer (but you'll probably have to go to Beechmont Audi to make that score)."

4900,September 2013,nyccarguy,My friend didn't remember the particulars of the exact sale price.  The MSRP was in the $37 - $38K neighborhood
4901,September 2013,graphicguy,"andres3....don't use my experience as a measuring stick.  I came to the conclusion a while ago that both dealers around me have relatively inept service depts.  But, as long as they keep me in some nice loaners (which they have), I'll put up with it...at least until the new '15 TLs come out."
4902,September 2013,igozoomzoom,"Even with all the revisions, the 2013 TL (especially the 'Base' model) is not appealing to me in the least.  It's not blatantly hideous like the 2009 version, but it's so bland looking down the boring wheel design.  The Special Edition looks much better, IMO."
4903,September 2013,sichin2000,"Having leased the original 335i (before kids) it was the best drive I ever had even tho it was in the shop for a blown accessory belt and the High Pressure Fuel pump.  The service, loaner car and refund of a lease payment does offset the inconvenience."

4905,September 2013,ivan_99,I took that statement referring to the design exclusively...meaning there hasn't been a dramatic change in design; such as the new impala compared to the old one.
4906,September 2013,andres3,"LOL, the difference between the 1.8 T and 2.0T is worlds apart if you ask me, and that's the 200 HP 2.0T version."
4907,September 2013,sichin2000,I know -  it was just a frame of reference for styling and how Audi used to be the leader and now seems stale and now Benz is the most progressive.

4916,September 2013,graphicguy,"FN...it seems like they've had the CLA announced for a year.  But, as you say, they aren't even in the showrooms, yet.  By the time they hit, all that ""pre""-delivery marketing will have been forgotten."

4918,September 2013,sweendogy,Not that I'm a leasing guy - the stats provided about are interesting. Why is Infiniti keeping this G around another year at discounted pricing? Is it to claim a market share gain vs the big boys ? I don't get it. 150 bux diff a month is real money on a car you don't own anyway.
4919,September 2013,igozoomzoom,"They've reduced the G37 lineup to just the RWD Journey and Base AWD models and they've cut the base price by $4,800 on both.  So the G37 Journey RWD starts at $32,550 for 2014 compared to 2013's base price of $37,350!  The only options available are the Premium Pkg (Leather, Moonroof, Bose) and Navigation Package."
4920,September 2013,sweendogy,"G37 might be an old design but put it up against the old tL, the tsxthe Audi a4 2.0 or even the new BMW 320 and its a huge bargain agreed.  Throw in a fancy lease lease rate and bam, market share. I still don't get it thou. Why confuse people more - every car will be a q right - but this ones a g.  At these prices makes you wonder why one, a person looking for a performing sedan and a deal would consider anything else - that includes the new q"
4921,September 2013,andres3,The only reason to get a Q50 over a G37 is if you have to have a bunch of sensors and cameras to help you avoid accidents.
4922,September 2013,sweendogy,"The interior of the G is Nissan like because its what Nissan took in later years from Infiniti, perfect example is gage cluster of maxima. I'm sure the Camry has Lexus like interior as well. Look the G is a 7 year old - it's not as modern as new cars but in function it all works very well- and given pricing its uber competitive."
4923,September 2013,tlong,Seems like Infiniti is nowhere near a market leader in this segment.
4924,September 2013,sweendogy,Thats like saying I like apples - what's the point you are making? Any value to go along or just a broad swipe with no real point?

I still have it over 100k miles later and have had very few major repairs.  In fact I've had such good luck that I recently bought a '01 BMW 330Ci Cabrio which is also giving me great service.

For those of you who post with more then opinion please go to true car and tell me what car on the right had side of this page has the performance, the features of the g at this pricepoint. Case in point price out a 320 x drive with sport and a couple of options - real money don't lie- the G is still the best car for the buck in class- and now we can thank Infiniti for the q for making this more of a landslide."

Maybe move the tsx for the q or the new caddy which has now been around for 6mths and all mags think it should be included -

We've been busy testing it, and we're really pleased at how responsive the company is to our requests.  We'll be doing a lot more testing prior to launch to do our best to make it a smooth transition."

4947,September 2013,markcincinnati,Review in Car and Driver of Q50S Hybrid -- not especially encouraging if you are a fan of the brand.
4948,September 2013,sweendogy,"No one is saying a test drive should not be used- but for someone, who is not constantly testing cars to write a review and that said review would be taking over a car mag is just ludicrous. I think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag- with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun. Not saying the information and experience was not of any value, but just less then a James Healey or consumer reports- and another few ticks lower then c&d and others."
4949,September 2013,markcincinnati,"I totally agree -- the early report from C/D however is a bit of a bummer (for those who were rooting for Infiniti and Johan, of course.)"
4950,September 2013,sweendogy,"Mark- have you read any other article on the car? The few I've read and watch are actually glowing, you mentioned the c&d one which I guess was about the hybrid. For those of us looking at a SUb 50 sports sedan would not consider a hybrid. Sure tesla has done it right; but what other hybrid is a real all around Lux sport sedan and at a price point of 50k, which I think is redik ."

I've only seen a couple on the road and I hear they are in short supply at dealers so the fact that you can get them readily at the rental counter is unusual.  Guess they wanted to get them out to be experienced by many and the people that tend to rent full size autos are probably their target audience on the most part.

4997,September 2013,m6user,"Maybe the reason the Q50 wasn't included in some of the comparos or extensive test drives was because of availability and the fact that the drive train didn't change that much if at all.   There's a review of the Q50 over on Left Lane News that is pretty positive in regards to the ""roar"" being a little tamer maybe due to sound proofing more than anything.  The quality of the interior pieces and the tech impressed them quite a bit.

The quotes Japanese bmw, The long post on the Audi discount I don't get- (audi club discount, really?) seems a bit drawn out and forced to prove some point which is never really given, is it a good or is it a tech driven value?  Or at the price point, like the g it really is 90% of Bmw driving and 110% Better in tech? I'm going to reserve my own thoughts on the q (ugly name) once I've driven it and once the experts have compared it to its true comp.  I would also note for real value seekers, if indeed there is a surplus of q50s on the lot and they are indeed good cars one could take advantage of such a mistake that someone else posted as infinitis fault at launch in lack of proper advertising."

Just because you think you are perfect doesn't mean you could never make a mistake or see something right at your bumper.

I remember something similar happened to Audi / Vw as they had failing coils in the turbo 4 - huge lines to get anything done even oil changes at dealerships as a result.
