On my Mustang there are vents in the front fascia that direct air through the wheel well to dissipate both air pressure and brake heat.. The Ford expert at the dealership took great pride in pointing them out.


But your vents are in the front and are mounted lower than what was thought could be louvers/vents that were mounted higher on the Camry next to the leading edge of the tail/brake light assembly. That is what I was questioning . Remember, I said ""there is nothing to cool back there"".

You're the perfect person to check this. Put some tape over your vents and see if it takes longer for your car to stop due to hotter brakes and see if the car handles worse, due to lift, than the way it handles now without the tape. If I had to put money on this test I'd say you will not see a difference. Sounds more like salesman hype than anything else to me but I can't prove it because I don't have a Mustang. Whatever you tell us after this test, I'll believe you.

I am sure oldfarmer is going to put duct tape on his vents and try to see if it makes his car faster and brake better. Regular cars probably don't benefit from having vents, but, if you are driving fast then it could make a difference...it does in racing cars. Spoilers probably don't do much for most people, but, people think they are attractive since they are associated with speed.

The vents do serve a purpose on some cars and that is the reason they are on the car. No use adding vents if - even phony ones, if they didn't have anything to do with the car. How much do these vents and spoiler help dissipate air pressure and brake heat?

Maybe your point is they don't actually lessen air pressure or heat. My point is they probably don't do those things for average cars, but, that is why they appear on cars...probably more decorative than useful at speeds under 100 m.p.h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was by accident that I stumbled upon looking at them after hearing a work colleague tell me about the one he just bought. I was knee deep in the Cadillac drama at the time.

But, it was quick, comfortable, handled fine, would be relatively cheap to own and maintain, reliable, well made, nice materials, all loaded up....for significantly less than $40K. And, that was the model before the newest redesign, which should be better than the one I drove.

Another vote will be taken on requiring all Condo Unit Owners to list the Condominium Association as an additional insured on our Condominium Insurance for liability as well as loss.

It had been highly customized and as it pulled up on the stage a trio of voluptuous women in WW2 WAC uniforms (The American Bombshells) piled out and gave an impromptu rendition of God Bless the USA.

They were hoping for $100k but the bidding stalled at $53k. Everyone was disappointed for the charity until one bidder stood up and donated $5,000 directly to the charity. Then another donated $5,000 and soon dozens of people were on their feet pledging between $1-5 thousand. I'm guessing the charity exceeded it's $100k goal by about 50 thousand.



We also got to hang out with Robbie Wolfe, the brother of one of the American Pickers and the person they call when they find cars. He says he has about a dozen cars in his collection and now is into collecting antique trucks. Very knowledgeable about what it costs to restore old cars. His opinion is that it's cheaper to just buy what you want at an auction rather than spend more doing it yourself. Evidently most cars cost more to restore than they bring at sale.

Well, I made it to September 22, 2018 - two years to the day after my liver cancer surgery. I guess that qualifies as a ""Cancer Survivor"" in medical circles. I owe everything to my Primary Care Physician who, because of his diligence in screening me for liver problems due to my Hepatitis C viral infection, discovered a lesion in my liver after a routine 6 month ultrasound. After many tests and a biopsy, I was referred to the liver transplant team at Broward Medical Center and underwent a liver resection which ended up removing 3 malignant tumors. Those doctors and nurses are also the reason I am still alive. My doctor continues to test for liver cancer with ultrasounds twice a year and a PET Scan once a year because this type of aggressive liver cancer has a tendency to re-establish itself in the liver. In other words, once you've had it, there's a good chance it can return. Thank God the Hepatitis C is no longer rampant in my body thanks to that new anti viral med, Epclusa. I will admit that I have not really felt well since that liver resection. I have become overly tired, sluggish, and insomnia has become a big problem, even with strong sleeping pills. But at least I am alive and can watch my grandchildren grow up and become strong men and one of them a great athlete. Can't wait to see what they eventually become of themselves. Now, back to cars!

I will try to say this as s-l-o-w-l-y as possible. The brakes heat up, the hot air from the brakes has to go somewhere, if it flows out through the louvers it will move away from the brakes - faster than it would if sealed up in the rear fender or wheel well.

Depends if the bird was weighed before or after the price was set.","They should be called vents, not louvers, my mistake. But, this from Bimmer link explains. They mostly, are used to move air out of wheel wells to reduce drag, but, a second benefit is to help cool heat build up around the brakes (funny, official site spells braking as breaking).

What is the purpose of fender vents?
The main purpose of fender vents is to relieve built-up air pressure from inside the wheel arches which causes aerodynamic lift. Typically, there are air intake openings in the front of the bumper directing air over the brakes to cool them. This air gets trapped in the wheel arches and creates high pressure resulting in lift over the front wheels reducing traction. Relieving this built up high-pressure system in the wheel arches reduces front axle lift thus increasing safety.

Trapped air in the wheel arches also creates aerodynamic drag. Drag is the force of air pushing in the opposite direction of the vehicle, reducing efficiency. Some research suggests wheel arches account for up to 30% of aerodynamic drag of a vehicle. With fuel efficiency ratings becoming increasingly more strict on modern vehicles you can understand why so much attention is being directed towards the reduction of this inefficiency. Efficiently routing air into and out of the wheel arches increases fuel economy through the reduction of drag.

Another benefit of fender vents is to efficiently vent hot air generated by heavy breaking out in the air stream. Quickly relieving hot air generated from the brakes makes room for more cool air to pass over the brakes, thus increasing efficiency. Finally, it is worth mentioning that trapped air in the wheel arches also contributes to cabin noise. Reduction of cabin noise is more pleasant to drivers on long trips reduces driver fatigue.

Hey guys, am I the only one that doesn't understand his logic? Anyway, I'm probably the only dope responding to this. jmonroe
Seems logical to me, having vents at the back allow for air to flow through the wheel well more efficiently allowing more air to flow over the brakes for more efficient cooling. It would also reduce drag.","

But the wheel wells are solid walls--they don't put holes in the wells for water, salt, dirt, and air to go through to other parts of the vehicle. So the wheels wells likely aren't being vented here.","

I'll just pass on what the experts say:

The rotating wheels effect air. The wheel well vents control this air flow.
Tremendous heat is developed in the ceramic - carbon braking systems to slow F1 cars. The vents provide cooling to the braking systems.
Most important the well vents along with the vents on the brake hubs are manipulated to control tire temperature which has significant effects on car performance. By changing the hub vents (varying the degree they are open) they can control the heat distribution in the brakes, rims and tires more uniformly.

Many vents today are decorative....but, it is a symbol for the reason they were first developed.....to keep pressure from building up in wheel wells, and to cool brakes.","

","Well, I made it to September 22, 2018 - two years to the day after my liver cancer surgery. I guess that qualifies as a ""Cancer Survivor"" in medical circles. I owe everything to my Primary Care Physician who, because of his diligence in screening me for liver problems due to my Hepatitis C viral infection, discovered a lesion in my liver after a routine 6 month ultrasound. After many tests and a biopsy, I was referred to the liver transplant team at Broward Medical Center and underwent a liver resection which ended up removing 3 malignant tumors. Those doctors and nurses are also the reason I am still alive.

My doctor continues to test for liver cancer with ultrasounds twice a year and a PET Scan once a year because this type of aggressive liver cancer has a tendency to re-establish itself in the liver. In other words, once you've had it, there's a good chance it can return. Thank God the Hepatitis C is no longer rampant in my body thanks to that new anti viral med, Epclusa.

I will admit that I have not really felt well since that liver resection. I have become overly tired, sluggish, and insomnia has become a big problem, even with strong sleeping pills. But at least I am alive and can watch my grandchildren grow up and become strong men and one of them a great athlete. Can't wait to see what they eventually become of themselves.

Now, back to cars!

The Camry and Avalon are quite good looking vehicles. I agree that the grille is a bit over the top in terms of design, as are most of the Lexus vehicles, but the most important aspects of a car are how it drives/handles, comfort, interior ergonomics, and safety features/technology.

I definitely would consider a Lexus ES350 or even a Camry or Avalon for my next car as I am definitely moving toward more economical purchases - no more Mercedes Benz or BMW - I've been there and done that. Now is the time for a nice car for basic transportation purposes only. So, over the next 2 years (until my lease is up), I will be looking at everything out there for my next car.

I just do not get the doc fee argument from dealers who say they have to charge the same amount to all buyers or be accused of discrimination. Why is the doc fee so sacred? Every other part of the deal from car price to interest rate, add-ons, extended service agreements and more varies from one deal to another and no 2 deals out of 100 are the same. If you apply the doc fee argument to every sale, every buyer would pay the same price.
jwm, let me put it another way:

If a dealer makes a “decision” to charge a dealer fee, it must be charged to ALL BUYERS of cars/trucks/SUV’s equally, without exception, per state statute/law.  Proof of this charge being nondiscrimatory is the fact that the “fee” is preprinted on the dealership’s buyer’s order and bill of sale for “every” transaction.  

The very top line on a bill of sale is a figure known as the “selling price.”  That figure is not the MSRP, but rather the agreed price of that vehicle’s sale price.  That number can be reduced by the amount of the “fee” in order to circumvent legal problems associated with the statute requiring that all sales must include the “fee” as required by the State in which a dealer fee is charged.  The State does not require a dealer fee - just that if a dealer fee is charged, every customer must be charged the same amount at the point of sale.

Thus, when I buy/lease a car from a dealership and refuse to pay the dealer fee, all they do is reduce the “selling price” by the amount of the dealer fee.  Then, it (amount of dealer fee) is added back at the bottom of the bill of sale - just playing with numbers.  The net affect is that I did not pay the fee as it was backed out of the selling price.

That’s how it is done.","

Florida does require that if a fee is charged, it “must “ be charged to everyone.  I tried looking up the requirement, but since I am not an attorney, I did not know where to look.

Then I'll be a bad guy for not tipping and denying an employee their rightful compensation. This whole thing is making me sick.

Car salespeople are in a different class of salesmen than 10-20 years ago.  They are trained to listen to the customer, determine the features the customer desires, identify objections to buying and are trained how to overcome those objections in a mild-mannered approach.  They are more client oriented than they used to be.  But there are still thousands of old school salesmen still out there trying to make a sale no matter what the customer says.

When I bought my '15 Genny it was from a dealer in Fairfax Virginia. I went there because this was the only dealer I could find (really found by Son #1) that had the car I wanted. A V8 in the exact color I wanted both exterior and interior, or so I thought at the time but that is another story I have since griped about but what is done is done so I have to live with that. I did my negotiating via phone calls after the initial internet visit which prompted the salesman to call. We had the typical back and forth negotiating via calls and as the salesman was off getting approval of the final number we agreed on, I noticed that the dealers internet page mentioned all prices did not include sales tax, plate fees, AND a doc fee of almost $600 (I think it was $580). Needless to say I missed that before but now that I knew it that got a rise out of me. I immediately called the salesman to tell him not to bother getting approval because we were not going to get to a deal now because of the high doc fee. He did the typical dealer song and dance about having to charge everybody that fee because it was preprinted on their sales document and it was a policy that could not be changed. I told him I understood it was their policy but my policy was not to pay an exorbitant doc fee. I also told him I didn't like them at all but at least in PA the doc fee was a more reasonable $138 (it is now $144) and the last time I bought a car in PA, I backed out the doc fee from the price of the car that the dealer wanted to allow for it. Just as I'm about to hang up I said something like, ""I understand your position so I'll just call the dealer in Akron who has my second color choice (which should have been my first choice. Yes, I'm still griping about the color) and buy from him. Still hung up about wanting my first color choice I said, ""I'll tell you what, since you have the color I want, if you drop your doc fee to $138 I'll buy your car but I doubt your boss will agree to this deal but if you want to try it I'll wait before calling the dealer in Akron. He said he'd get back to me within a half hour to let me know so ""please don't do anything until I get back to you"". I agreed. He calls back in 15 minutes and says we have a deal but the sales contract will still say $580. They will adjust the price of their car and show more for my trade ('09 Genny), however, they still have to decide how to break that up but he assures me the bottom line will be what we agreed to as the final price. I asked for and received an email confirming this. So they can do it when they want to and obviously they wanted to.

I pass this info on not so much to show that a dealer can do a reasonable deal when they want to but to point out to you guys, and once again remind myself, that as much as we THINK we know how to do a deal based on our research, we don't really know how much trunk money there is to play with. We only THINK we know. In the end, as long as the dealer meets our number (assuming we know something), we have nothing to complain about.

Not really a surprise to me. When your all-new car looks like a 9/10s scale copy of the previous edition and prospective customers cannot tell them apart then you have made a serious error.

They could have had a better backdrop. That might be influencing perceptions","
I think you hit it. By increasing the doc fees, dealers are trying to ""lock in"" more and more profit to themselves rather than sharing it with the employees. They think they are giving ""motivation"" to their workforce to hunt for the extra money from their customers. However, in current internet pricing era, we've reaching the point, where it doesn't work anymore. With knowledge on the ""nominal spread"" and faced with steep $1000 fee, customer who knows enough will simply refuse any decent markup, pay only X amount and you figure it out how you write it. The salesperson gets a mini anyway. Then why bother at all? A rational reaction would be to focus on volume, not price.","
CT200h was a dog. I drove it, it had an acceleration of Geo Metro from 30 years ago. Very underwhelming.",Isn't Florida notorious for dealer rip-offs?,"
It's rare to see a Toyota criticized. Refreshing.","part of the problem might be that the compensation model no longer makes sense with the way pricing is done now. So it would be a lot easier to just move to a non-commission pay model. Basically a salary + bonus per unit? There are some dealers around here that advertise non-commissioned sales people. Probably like a waiter, the base would not be that high, but they would get a couple hundred maybe per unit. so there is still incentive to sell more.

sales people don't really care that much about the price I don't think, since most deals are minis anyway. So they sort of are on a volume pay plan.

seems counterproductive for dealers to work this hard to screw their employees, which mostly leads to constant turn over. Guess making it a better customer experience is not relevant to them."

Have you met Mike? ","graphicguy said:
Why would any knowledgeable car buyer allow a car sales person to engage them in a discussion which the sales person intends to use to eliminate and/or identify perceived ""objections""? The single most important component of a solid buying strategy is for the buyer to assume control of the process. An essential part of assuming control is control of the discussion.
Old school thinking. The old “I’ll control the sales process”. If control is what you want, roll into the showroom with a wad of Benjamins and yell to anyone who will listen “who wants to sell me a car?”. You want to waste time? Keep trying to work towards controlling instead of getting the car you want at the deal you want. I’ve said this time and again, if you walk into the dealership thinking you’re going to grind, you’ll lose. 1. You don’t know the price you’re going to pay before you walk in the door because you’re focused on grinding that last $50 instead of what you’ll be spending overall 2. What you save on the front end, you’ll give away on the back end. For the last 15-20 years, I figure out what the car is worth and what it can be sold for. I add in my “pre-figured” tax, title and license fees. And, then present that number to the sales person/manager. They can either accept it or reject it. If they reject it, I move on. If they accept it, I just bought a car. They get ONE NUMBER. I don’t care what their doc fee is. I don’t care what addies they may try to charge for. There’s no bumping for extraneous fees in F&I. The number is the number. Negotions are easy. No stress. I’m happy with the deal (since I penciled it) and the dealer is happy with the deal (since they accepted it). It’s quick, too.
I work from a similar standpoint. I usually get my numbers off TrueCar, add 6.25% sales tax, and $300 for license plates, doc fees, etc. That is the number, take it or leave it, thank you very much. The last new truck I bought actually wound up lower than TrueCar. The dealership had an online sales price which was several hundred lower than TrueCar. When I came in, they wanted to add about $1,000 for “dealer add ons” (wheel locks, door edge guards, etc). I politely declined, said, “I will pay your advertised price, plus 6.25%, plus $300. End of story.” After a few minutes of hedging around, they agreed, the deal was made. They had done one thing which I had not seen before. For all of their vehicles, they took the window sticker and laminated it, along with an extra piece with the dealer add ons, all laminated together to look like one document. I guess they think this will make the add ons look more “official”.
That works for me. I'll usually look at TrueCar. Look at their online ads. Nose around their lot after hours to see what their stock situation is (that tells me if they have a little or a lot of what I'm looking at). I don't care how they divy up my number either. Not so much any more, but I used to hear the dealers say that their ""doc fee"" was required by law. Every time I asked them which law they could point me to outlining that fee, they backed off. I don't even argue with them any more. I make the one offer. That's it.
The “law” is stated: “If you charge a dealer fee, it must be pre-printed on all buyer’s orders and bills of sales and charged to ALL buyers.”  There are no State laws that require dealer fees.

The way a dealer can bypass that fee is to lower the selling price by the amount of the fee.","Guys, the only reason I presented the “overcoming buyer’s objections” is to educate you as to how salesmen are trained.  This way, you enter the new car showroom well prepared for the “modus operandi” of the well-trained salesman.

The question was asked: “How quickly or early on can you tell if a customer is truly a buyer or just a tire kicker?”  If the salesman follows his training model, I would presume he will know who is a buyer or not when there is more than one objection, other than price, that cannot be overcome.

All I was doing was to present to you what to look out for when working with a well-trained professional salesman.  Hope it was informative. ","

The Turbo model in those years used a Japanese Aisin transmission for some reason, not a THM like the others. Perhaps the programming for the computer lost something in translation.

Here's a pic of mine:","
Of course, Mike. It's good to know the fee value before, so you can prepare yourself to lower the ""price"" accordingly, if you're talking in that particular format.

My beef is mostly with the truth in advertising, not whether price is too high, too low, or if they ""deserve"" their ""money for nothing"" fee. You open newspaper with a screaming ""starting at"", ""you pay"", or whatever and you have to make all that math. I think it crossed the line where it's no longer just a ""format"", it's a clear lie. Screaming ""you pay"", then you need to add $3000 in trade (you still pay it, just in a different form, i.e. barter), $1000 in fee, sometimes another $1000 in manufacturer's destination, as it was excluded from ""you pay"" shout, THEN of course add all the taxes and registration. At some point it becomes ridiculous and completely useless.

Airlines used to do that, too (Fly New York from $59, one way fare based on round trip, taxes, fees not included), but they were finally prohibited. Today they have to advertise OTD price, they might be allowed break it into one-way I believe, but that's it. It's time similar laws are passed for the car industry, as it clearly has no interest in clearing itself from all that BS, if anything it keeps ratcheting it up. It may be a bit harder, but I still think they can manage - it's not that hard to add all the fees and even state government taxes and registration fees, based on a common scenario prescribed by the legislator, e.g. taxes, title and 1 year registration at jurisdiction specific to the dealer with disclaimer that people outside of the county may pay more or less. Same thing can be done with lease or loan payments - clearly stated jurisdiction, interest rate, down payment and other assumptions. But wait... people would be shocked cars are so expensive. People can't know how much they are actually paying. They'd stay home and the economy would collapse. We can't have that - deception is the only way to keep the economy rolling.","So does that make Google CarPlay and Android Auto obsolete?

When I showed up at the dealership he had one of the assistants they had there take me out in his demo Fusion. It was a used car he was driving at the time. It said ""9 miles to empty"" on the gas gauge and the brakes were shot. You had to pump them to stop.

He just didn't seem interested so I left.

A year or so later he made a comment that I wasn't a serious buyer then. He couldn't have been more wrong. I bought a Buick Regal 2 days later.

It makes you wonder how often this happens and how many sales are lost because a salesperson is a know-it-all.","Why would any knowledgeable car buyer allow a car sales person to engage them in a discussion which the sales person intends to use to eliminate and/or identify perceived ""objections""?

The single most important component of a solid buying strategy is for the buyer to assume control of the process. An essential part of assuming control is control of the discussion.","
Determining whether a customer is a buyer or not is not the single most important element in sales.  The most important element is developing a relationship with the customer.

Just because a customer comes into the showroom and states they are just looking or they are comparing brands is not important.  The job is to turn that looker into a future customer who will come back asking for you.

I can’t tell you how many “lookers” have bought cars from me that first visit - it’s because I was interested in what they wanted or needed or just providing him/her with honest and truthful information.  It’s developing a relationship with the customer.","karhill1 said:

Why?  Because that is how sales are made, karhill.  Most customers are not as aggressive as you claim they are or should be.  Whenever I would greet an aggressive or cocky customer, I just relaxed and let him control things until I had developed a relationship.  Rather than fight him, i just relaxed.  If I felt I was being “run over” by a customer, I let him “run me over” until he satisfied himself that he was in total control.  That is the way to deal with aggressive buyers.  Provide answers to his questions and if the interactions became overwhelming, I just thanked him for coming in.

Obnoxious customers are different.  They not only want control, but are nasty and antagonistic.  Those are the ones I just let the sales manager handle when I sold cars.  When I was a sales manager, if they continued their “run me over” attitude, I just gave them the name of a competing dealership and showed them the door.

But those cases were few and far between - thank goodness.","
Everyone is a payment buyer, the question is how many payments are they going to make?","karhill1 said:

The customer always has control, they are the one who decides if there will be a sale or not. The salesman can control the conversation all he wants, I control the sale.","
Not really. The real questions are how much do you want for the car, what's the cost of the money (if applicable) in a particular form of financing, and how much will you give me for my car, if I trade in. The payment will come out of that automatically and in places I have bought my cars the don't make ""math errors"" at F&I. If they did, that would be end of discussion. I could afford twice or now even thrice the payment that is appropriate for a vehicle and term I'm seeking (not that it would be a good idea), so discussion of $XX per month is completely irrelevant to me.

""Afford"" is never a question to me for the vehicles I'm buying - I figure that way before I come to a place, it's only how much do you will sell it for, so all that discussion on Youtube, while entertaining, makes no difference to me - other than any attempt like that would make me walk away after couple of minutes. I suspect though, really good salesman/closer would know that, so they'd keep things on target. Especially, considering that I'm not overly ""greedy"" on my expectations. I won't let them push me into excessive markups, but I don't need a ""deal of a Century"" to close, either. And ""per month"" screamer offers really annoy me, especially if they don't disclose enough pertinent details (which always is the case). I remember once a young Mazda guy (long time ago) insisted on them to pencil me an ""offer"", after I just wanted to test drive it. I had another 30 minutes to kill, so I said OK. Then he brings that magic XX/month for 60 months on some form. So I ask him what's the interest rate, ""I don't know"", show me components for this number, he stared at me like I just asked him to write a Shrodinger's equation. I knew that was it, so I thanked him for his time. He was still asking ""is the number OK?"", I was like ""I don't know enough to say"". I wasn't buying anyway, but the approach to business told me this was NOT the place I wanted to go, if actually shopped for Mazda.","
I treated every person that walked into our showroom as a potential buyer in that I gave everyone the same amount of attention and respect. My second sale was to a couple that were ""just looking"" to replace their totaled E46 M3; they test drove an M240i and at the end of the test drive decided to buy it on the spot. What was really kind of funny was that the salesman who usually exceeded his targets every month had a couple coming in to look at the same car. They rolled up just after my NCM accepted my customers' offer. The other customers didn't have a deposit on the car so they only got a quick glance at it before I drove it to the detail bay...","
Same here; the thing was, those obnoxious jerks could get a fantastic deal and they would still trash you on the survey, so for me it just wasn't worth it.","Number one (gotta talk to the wife) is my go to excuse. Though I did have a dealer tell me to take a car home overnight. That was fun.

That has a name. It’s called the “ puppy dog close”","
A**holes are everywhere, customers, salespeople, managers. It's quite funny. I know the type - the world is out to get them, constantly unhappy, constantly smelling a conspiracy. However, I do keep my guard in places I described before (some of those ""popular"" brand dealership). Those places bring worst in people on both sides. They breed not only bad sales and managing staff, they also breed bad customers. Many people would become combative and nasty after experiencing enough of that stuff over there that they won't believe that other places can do business a different way. If you are a Honda buyer in Tampa Bay, for example, you simply have no choice but endure this boiler room environment, if you want to buy one. The curse with them is that the product is good enough for people to take that abuse - especially that stored of their direct competitor, Toyota, is not much better, or can be worse. Buy three-four Hondas or Toyotas that way and you believe everybody else is like that.

BTW, there were some other outfits in the area that were even worse, literally criminal. The most infamous was thank God defunct Bill Heards Chevrolet. You read stuff you can't even believe was possible. I only think those people who used to work in place like that - how they slept at night and looked at the mirror in the morning.","@abacomike ...only when you have a solid selection, the negotiations can start....

Mike....could not agree with you more. If the selection isn’t done, or you’re just kicking tires on more than one car, nothing’s going to happen.

I can’t tell you how many sales people have tried to close me in the lot while I’m browsing several cars.

Some examples...

“You buying today?”-I dunno.....I’m not sure you have anything I want.

“This is a great car for families. Yours would love it”.-The car would be only for me.

“The car you’re looking at is one of our most popular colors”-I’m not very fond of it.

“Let’s fill out a credit app to save you time”.-Ummmmm.....let’s not. I don’t even know if you have what I want.

The list goes on and on. All resulting in a “no sale”.","
Old school thinking. The old “I’ll control the sales process”. If control is what you want, roll into the showroom with a wad of Benjamins and yell to anyone who will listen “who wants to sell me a car?”.

You want to waste time? Keep trying to work towards controlling instead of getting the car you want at the deal you want.

I’ve said this time and again, if you walk into the dealership thinking you’re going to grind, you’ll lose.

1. You don’t know the price you’re going to pay before you walk in the door because you’re focused on grinding that last $50 instead of what you’ll be spending overall

2. What you save on the front end, you’ll give away on the back end.

For the last 15-20 years, I figure out what the car is worth and what it can be sold for. I add in my “pre-figured” tax, title and license fees. And, then present that number to the sales person/manager. They can either accept it or reject it. If they reject it, I move on. If they accept it, I just bought a car.

They get ONE NUMBER. I don’t care what their doc fee is. I don’t care what addies they may try to charge for. There’s no bumping for extraneous fees in F&I. The number is the number.

Negotions are easy. No stress. I’m happy with the deal (since I penciled it) and the dealer is happy with the deal (since they accepted it). It’s quick, too.","Number one (gotta talk to the wife) is my go to excuse.

Not really. And a lot of other stuff deleted to save bandwidth so there more room on the internet for cat memes.
Well unless the dealership is giving away cars everyone is a payment buyer, even if it is just one payment. 

Personally I really don't care how they come up with the numbers, in the end all that matters is how the cash flows. If I want that new Sludgemobile LX and my research shows that $25K is a real good price and I will put down $5K and I can get a 48 month loan at 4% then I know my monthly payment would be $502.95 a month (presuming 8.5% sales tax and $150 for tags). Now if they come up with that monthly payment or less why should I care how they got it? It still meets or beats what I figured out was a good deal. If they give me the car for free charge me $6K in doc fees and charge me 363.5% interest for 48 months I'm still at the $502.95 a month.","Today it really is much easier, as you can see the inventory on line, so you can figure out real price before walking in. It wasn't as easy years ago, you didn't know what they had and the range of prices is too large to come with ""one number"", unless you come with exact configuration in mind and you either hit it or not. Otherwise, you'd need some formula to figure it out on the spot.

I was fortunate not to run into too many ""buy today"" people. Probably because I stayed away from those places, but most likely they almost never had the configuration I wanted. My taste has always been ""off the mainstream"".

For example, last time I bought my 430, I came to a Volvo place, as I considered red V60 wagon, R-trim. But they don't have a single V60-R in stock, other dealers in the area may have couple in black or white. They have S60 sedan in the same engine trim. I ask them to show it to me and I want to test drive it. I'd mention multiple times during the test drive that I'm also considering 430, I would tell them what I like, what I don't and I still have things to look at. We talk enough details so they know I didn't come to joyride, I'm really looking into it, most likely an order. We may even mention pricing (their usual opening salvo is MSRP, or something like 1000 bucks off). I may discuss it further, or not, depends on my mood. There is no room for ""close today"" in this whole conversation no matter how much they may try and they know they'd likely lose the sale if they started the whole dance and push right now. We shake hands, I take the card and keep contact until decide. I'd do that in two-three dealerships per model, as there is always something new to learn about the car each time. Once I decide what, I take an offer from one dealer away, so I know I have somewhere to go and I go to the frontrunner. I strike the deal based on that offer with an extra concession, but nothing outrageous, they agree fairly quickly. It most likely leaves something on the table, but I don't care. I let the rest know it's over, I owe them that much.","
So... just as an example, someone born in 1900 would add their age, 118, to their birth year and get 2018. Well...yes... because addition works. It also worked EVERY year.

At the very beginning of this YouTube training presentation, what the trainer did was to identify objections to purchasing the car.  What he said was, “...if I understand you correctly, aside from the payment of $600 per month for 60 months, is there anything else keeping you from buying the car...?” or something very close to that.  What he is trying to do is teach the salesmen about identifying objections to buying the car and dealing with those objections.  He even mentioned to the buyer about having selected the right car.  This is intended to isolate the main objection to make sure you are dealing with the one reason keeping the salesman from closing the deal.  In this scenarios, the only objections to buying the car was the monthly payment.

Now the salesman will go over the selected vehicle and its features to see if an adjustment to the selected vehicle can be made, i.e., a model with less equipment in order to move the negotiations closer to a conclusion.  A car without LED lights might be enough to bring the cost down to $560 a month and even lower to close the deal.

Selection of a vehicle is essential to determine if the customer is a buyer.  In other words, “...sir, if the price is right, is this the vehicle you want to take home with you?...”

The answer to that one question after a car is selected will determine if the customer is a buyer.  Examples of possible responses are:

1 Well, I need my wife here to decide
2 I don't have my checkbook
3 I have 4 more payments left on my lease
4 I really wanted leather seats..or..etc.
5 Well, I am really just looking
6 The car is for my daughter
7 Yes!

Answers 1-6 are objections to buying now.  It means the salesman must eliminate all objections except the price before he can proceed.  

1 Here’s the Keys- Drive It home and let her see it.

2 A credit card is fine or we have an internal draft you can sign until you bring in the check

3 I can take care of those remaining payments by buying the car from the leasing company

4 I have a car in stock exactly the way you want it equipped with leather seats “or” I can get that exact car by tomorrow morning 

5 No problem.  We have the car you want and I know we can price it right where you want to be.  How much did You want to pay?  $600 a month?  I know I can get it st that price or possibly less.

6 Let’s Drive the car to your daughter and have her test drive the car to see if it fits her needs.

and I think leasing is the best way to make your negative equity disappear (I think Mike basically did this?). Can roll lots of messy stuff into the right lease, and you basically are financing your neg equity at a really low interest rate. You go from upside down to even in 3 years (when the lease ends, and you are back at square one).

Yes, Dino - exactly what I did.","
Thanks @stickguy ...exactly what I’m looking for. I do have some annuities getting ready to max out. My “plan” takes me to 62 when they all max out. With my other investments, I was planning on drawing down at 65. But, I also plan on working until 62, take a few years to use discretionary money to sell assets (like my house) and reinvest into smaller digs.

Seeing what you guys are leasing, and what you’re leasing, and considering I’ll never keep a car 10 years (let alone 5 years), I’m starting to get interested in leasing.

Athough, if there’s a car I would consider keeping for another several years, it would be my current Acura. It’s been a long time since I’ve liked a car this much. Not the sportiest, fastest, etc car I’ve ever owned. But, it sure is satisfying overall....especially for the price.","

Not sure how that works, especially since the banks tightened credit qualifications. But, some of the predatory lending practices have been reinstated. So, maybe very high, sub prime interest rates are now possible again.

Credit Unions are usually more strict in their lending policies. I don’t think they’d be a target to give lend money on a sub prime risk.

My late Father drilled it into my head from an early age.....if you can’t afford something easily, don’t buy it.

With that as a guide, I’ve found that rolling over negative equity into another loan (especially on a depreciating asset....like a car) is a downward spiral. You are essentially trying to fix a broken financial situation by breaking it even more. You’re going in the wrong direction. You’re adding more negative equity to an already poor financial situation.

I will never give any financial advice, as I’m not qualified to do so. Just making some common sense observations.","All right, you guys.

Nissan's Altima - for it's nice mix of style, comfort and fuel economy.","Back in the '80s/'90s Chrysler products used to be the most stolen not because they were good or valuable cars, but because their locks were the easiest to overcome. So there's that.","This statistic is meaningless in terms of actual theft risk assessment without comparison to number of registered vehicles of each model. If 1 Ferrari is stolen out of 100 registered, the risk of theft is 100 times higher than say 100 stolen Civics out of 1 million registered.","

$15/month is a lot! It's $180/year. In my case, that would be more than 15 percent of the premium. I never think it terms ""per month"".

driver100 - have you not read this story before? 

A man was going down the road from the city of Jerusalem to Jericho. This man was a Jew. As he was walking along, robbers grabbed him. They knocked him down and took his money and his clothes. The robbers beat him up and left him half dead beside the road.
 A short time later, a priest came along that road. He saw the man who was badly hurt. What would you have done?— Well, the priest just went by on the opposite side of the road. He didn’t even stop. He didn’t do anything at all to help the man.
Did you catch the point, driver100? The priest didn't do anything to help the downed Jewish man. Now, you guys know me, I'm not going to get all religious on ya. But that old account from thousands of years ago totally describes what's happening now on the earth. Most people would rather spit on you than help you when you're down. For that poor Jewish man, he was already robbed and beaten. I'll bet that priest would gladly take your tithe on Sunday morning, yet he wouldn't stop and help a man beaten and left for dead on the side of the road. There's a huge moral story told by that one Bible account.","
So what? I own 4 vehicles and I'm the only one who drives them. If he can swing the expense I say go for it.. At least he'll have a back up for when the Sentra is in the shop.",My scrolling thumb is getting quite the workout today. ;b,I'm just going to keep on keeping on...,"
How about negotiating by email first.? Even I got information on line before I traveled for my last purchase. At least you'd have some proof if the salesman changes his tune once you arrive.","I'm already doing that now. I am also negotiating for a 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo with 15,XXX miles on it. The base model is at Avondale Nissan. The SR Turbo is at an independent used car dealer. Things are heating up because I've got them bucking against each other to win my bid-ness.","
That sounds like the same faint praise that Mitsubishi gets from the auto press. Maybe those two companies don't grease the right palms. I personally find the Altima much superior but there's nothing wrong with the Sentra.

BTW, can someone walk me through updating my cars owned list on here? I did it in my profile but forget how I did it to get the car to show under my posts.",I think I burned out the scroll wheel.,"
How's this for a complicated deal......my niece wants to buy her brother's 2017 Civic. Brother bought it in Maryland and rolled negative equity from his trade into the loan. Loan is from Maryland and in that state I understand the bank keeps the title. Indications are he owes $22k on a car worth maybe $16k. Niece has no credit history to speak of so her parents need to cosign. They have tier 1credit but are carrying a lot of debt.

I told them they might have to put in some cash but I'm not sure how much. Are credit unions loaning more than 100% on used cars these days?","
He pays off the negative equity. Why would she pay more than the car is worth? Otherwise, run away. Lease a new Civic if necessary.","Since 2001 I've covered four BMW press introductions for Roundel magazine; one was a US intro, the rest were International intros. In two cases I was able to drive a car home and keep it for 10 days. In addition I was loaned two additional cars for other Roundel stories I was writing.
It's no secret that BMW treats journalists very well. That said, it didn't keep Car and Driver from criticizing Munich's lurch towards isolation and away from communicative steering and competent suspensions. A BMW didn't even make the 10 Best list this year. Road & Track was decidedly lukewarm towards the M235i when it was introduced. My latest article covering the intro of the F16 X6 was less than complementary, but I have not been called to task by either my editor or BMW.

All of the above is a roundabout way of saying that I don't think the majority of automotive writers for the major car magazines have a bias against a particular marque. As dino001 correctly observed, most writers are car enthusiasts, and an average car at the rock bottom of the market that does not distinguish itself in any way is simply not going to receive enthusiastic plaudits. Some of my cars have been praised by one magazine and seriously criticized by others. That doesn't bother me- but when every enthusiast magazine I trust agrees that a vehicle is not at all impressive I almost certainly won't consider owning it.

And I can honestly state that I have never purchased a vehicle that finished last in a 5-6 car CD comparison test.
But that's just me","
Good point. I think having brother pay off the negitive equity is in the plan somewhere.","
The Sentra certainly is uninspiring, That said, that's what I bought for my son when he started college. He didn't want anything ""flashy"". It served him well for 5 years of college and his first year of work. All we did to it was an occasional oil change and threw a couple of tires on it.

When he was finished with it, it looked tired and a little ragged. He traded it on a new BMW.

If anyone expects any more than that out of a Sentra, they will be disappointed.","
Precisely, it's an appliance; if you know that going in you won't be disappointed(much).","
Right before I bought the Legacy I stopped at the Honda dealer to look at the Civic. The place made my skin crawl. I thought it was just me.

It's a good deal worse then that. If I recall correctly, he owes about $5k on the Kia Soul, putting him upside down about $3k. And it doesn't sound like he has the money to pay off the Kia, so he will have to fold that into the next purchase.

U.S. News - Ranking of Compact Cars","driver100 said:
btw....most of the reviews I am looking at for the Sentra give it 3 stars out of 5. Edmunds sums it up pretty nicely; That said, nothing about the Sentra stands out in the class. Its base engine is one of the slowest available, and even the optional turbocharged engine lags behind some competitors in terms of outright performance. There are also rival sedans that offer nicer interiors and greater degrees of comfort and technology. A good example is the Kia Forte, which has an extensive list of optional features for a reasonable price. There's also the all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza that has many excellent active safety features and driver aids available. Finally, the Honda Civic, when equipped with its available turbocharged 1.5-liter engine, is our overall favorite vehicle in the class EDMUNDS REVIEW I will say Cars.com gives it glowing reviews. U.S. News rates it high but says there are much better cars in this class, with #1 being a Kia Soul. Car & Driver with 2 1/2 stars had this to say; The Sentra has a reputation as a reliable ride at an affordable price, but driving fun is lacking. The SR Turbo has more pep, but it can’t completely hide the car’s basic shortcomings. The tall, boxy body rolls in turns, while the steering is too light, and the brakes do not inspire confidence. Numerous options allow you to tailor the Sentra to your tastes, and the back seat is roomy, but the interior design is plain. Infotainment is good, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered.
Doesn't matter, if he likes the car what does it matter what the reviews are. Drive what you like.","
I agree, but I'm always surprised at how a person can lust after a vehicle that most every reviewer thinks is uninspiring at best.
Well, they say that there's a butt for every seat...","That's right, snake, I will drive what I like! Duh.

The price of the base 6-speed Sentra I'm going for is $13,490. My trade will add to that amount, yes. I think I can strike a do-able deal still.

Also, not all car write-ups are written honestly. I don't believe about 80% of those reviews of the Sentra. They're rubbish!","Well I am back with a new improved name, Houdini2. Doesn't look like I've missed much, but I just read the last couple of pages. I am on pins and needles hoping the best deal Iluv can get on the Sentra is around $30,000. so he will change gears and check out that Kia Forte that driver mentioned.","
Jumping right into the fray, I see. Welcome back!","As my father in law loves to say ""hard head, soft bottom""!","
I woudn't go so far. I think they are written from certain point of view. It's about reviewer's opinion if there are better products for the same price. The issue is sometimes they use wrong reference points, e.g. MSRP, not actual ""street price"". Some manufacturers price things much closer to street prices than others. Nissan seems to be middle of the road in that department. Its price list usually is on par with say Honda or Toyota product, but the transaction prices are often lower by some decent margin. The reviewers are too lazy (or don't know enough) to account for that. That being said, if somebody thinks that Kia is better (and those often sell at even greater discounts), then this could be a sign.

Another aspect is, small sedan is a very dull segment with cutthroat competition, so the reviewers look for differentiation. It could be looks, equipment, performance, handling, or utility. Sentra is competent evewhere, but does not seem to excel anywhere, so it gets knocked down by people who look for ""something special"" at that price point. It's not malicious, corrupt, or wrong. It's just a different expectations.

If that Sentra was so wrong, it would not sell in those numbers. I say the same - drive what you like, even if it's something I wouldn't want.","one other thing to keep in mind, is most tests/reviews are on the auto trans models. Comparing with a stick (where even available) could make a reasonable difference. Some cars get hammered for a crappy trans.","
Especially in the small sedan category. Some of those transmissions are real dogs.","Well, I remember years and years ago sticking up for Kia on Edmunds.com. Basically I was told to go fly a kite. And look what's happened, gentlemen. Kia is now right up there and selling well. I know a good sedan when I see one. And the Nissan Sentra S at $13,490 is a bargain. Period. 

I appreciate your review on car reviews, dino001. I've gotten used to punting them. Not your review, dino001. I mean the mainstream media reviews. They're rubbish. You really have to do your own evaluation of the car you're interested in. Do not put your trust in men. History shows they'll string you up and fry you for dinner instead of helping you.","
Sounds like the classic case of...I don't want to hear what I don't want to hear.

jmonroe",,I saw a Stinger live in my fair village today. I had to get closer to figure out what kind of Kia it was. Didn't look like an Optima.,"
It's a nice car, lots of praise. Looks a bit ""heavy"" to me, but I still will take a test drive when time comes. I guess actually knowing how it drives is worth taking a long hot shower after the upscale experience of our local Kia dealers. I don't care for its gas mileage, but for 10 grand price difference (from other candidates) I could buy a lot of gas.","I use car reviews the way I use most reviews. If 90% of the reviewers find the same fault...it is usually true. If 90% say driving the car is not a fun experience, then that carries some weight. If it is a fault I don't care about, like a small glove compartment....then I toss that information out of the equation.

What stick said is true, a manual is usually more entertaining than an automatic, which is what they usually test. But, lack of power can be really frustrating in a manual too, as we found out in the Passat.

I haven't heard the expression "" History shows they'll string you up and fry you for dinner instead of helping you"", not sure who came to that conclusion.....is that pertaining to cannibals?","
I have the same problem going to those. Since I bought my 2003 WRX, I was spoiled by a straightforward experience I got in both Subaru and BMW dealerships. I didn't always hear what I wanted to hear, but I never had anybody going back on anything. On the other hand, stories I heard from others about their experiences buying their ""mainstream"" cars were just appalling. Korean and Japanese seem to be worst offenders, by far - at least anecdotally. I truly abhor Honda places - they give me real creeps, every time I step in. More even so than Hyundai or Kia. Don't even know exactly why. Perhaps it's those shameless worthless add-ons and ADM stickers still lingering there on some vehicles. Recently our new employee, a young UF masters grad bought a new CRV (nice vehicle) with one of those ""packages"" and the thing wasn't even put on the vehicle. Won't even mention how the whole ""dealing"" went when he was buying. It took him to go to a manager to execute on that stuff. His salesman wouldn't take a call and was gone within couple of weeks, anyway. Just plain awful stuff, but they get away with it, because... you guessed it, ""it's a Honda"".

I just learned to limit my exposure to those places to bare minimum, which ended up being four-five times in last 15 years, when I thought I was shopping for something (then changed my mind). Lucky me, I can afford to be picky.","
Have you ever driven a new Sentra?","my take on the reviews is to read the comments, and ignore the results (rankings). Especially with sources that have a narrow focus. Car and Driver is like that. Not wrong or bad necessarily, just the way it is. They will always pick the car that is sportiest (best handling, whatever).

better to look at what they find, and rank based on your own criteria. So if they put a car last that is quiet, comfortable, and soft handling, if that is exactly what you want you might rank it first over something that is noisy and rough but handles like a go cart.

somethings though are pretty cut and dried. performance numbers, lousy brakes, tons of road noise.","I think its his money and his preferences - so be it. Time to move on.

My opinion is that most reviews are naturally going to reflect the reviewers leanings no matter how hard they try to avoid that. So it is a good idea to read a group of different reviews, just like on things like Amazon where it is a good idea to read the ""average"" reviews more than the excellent or terrible ones."

Well, that answers that question...","The hazards are the reason for the pay, not the 99% of the job that is far from risky. I'm not sure it has ever been in the top 10 most dangerous jobs. I have no issues with the salaries, but I don't buy any claims that there are poverty wages.

Disrespect? Respect is to be earned, right? Probably 95%+ of the profession earns respect, but a small yet loud subset does not, and the good ones continue to protect the bad. Much of that disrespect can be linked to internal actions.
","Probably similar to the claims by supporters of publicly financed sports facilities of positive business impacts around a given arena. I wouldn't doubt that it is more efficient to simply give the money away. But this way we get to help those who are already so overtaxed and underappreciated, so it all works out.

Step away from the bong.","
Hah! I went through this myself when I was working, it was about 2012 or so. The VOIP phones worked almost the same as the old ones but many of the commands we had all memorized were just different enough to throw people off. For a few weeks it was sheer hell trying to change a voicemail greeting, do a conference, etc. The other thing was that it plugged into your PC so if you had a laptop and it was disconnected for some reason your phone did not work. Eventually it all settled out and the second phone went away.","
Agreed; my son and I watch Live PD and he cracks up when I(usually) predict what the perp will say when questioned by an officer. The defendants often carry that same winning attitude into the courtroom and are actually surprised when the prosecutor refuses to offer a plea deal as a result.","It's almost like you've done this for a living, @roadburner!","
I have a different take on this. My perception may be different from yours because we don't have many gunfights with police up here so the job is somewhat different. First of all, nobody ""deserves all they can get"" in a public sector job. That sort of entitled attitude brings nothing but problems with it in that environment. We see that in our PD locally where despite most constables making 6 figures plus lavish benefits, there was a systematic ransacking purloining of cash, drugs and other evidence from the property room here for a number of years which the current chief has dragged his heels to even come clean on, much less fix, because it would make so many officers into criminals.

I think most people who go into police work are of a certain mindset and personality type. Most of us wouldn't last a week in the job because we are not that kind of personality. While some seem to have a genuine desire to help people and seek to correct injustice, many others seem to delight in simply having power over citizens. I noticed as well in my work life, where we hired retired PD officers to run our security and loss prevention units, that the longer one is in the police force, the more rigid, jaundiced and discriminatory they seem to become.","
I have noticed this as well. Police Officers, the ones who work the streets, seem to be constantly exposed to the worst side of humanity, and that seems to dehumanize them.

2018 Sentra base w/manual trans.....$15,000 (probably closer to $16,000 given the dealer will have to overallow on the trade)+ TTL.

2011 Kia Soul base w/manual trans (not sure the mileage, but let’s average 12K/year for 84K miles)......$2K trade (and you’re going to have to work hard to get that). I say the dealer comes in between $1,200 and $1,500 trade on first pencil.","
The idea of guaranteed, no-strings income has been floated around for a long time, and some smaller cities have already launched experimental programs.

My son is a police officer. It is a dangerous job precisely because it can go from being perfectly ordinary to life threatening in a heartbeat. It’s very stressful. He is not on a power trip and he does not make a six figure salary.

That said, nothing about the Sentra stands out in the class. Its base engine is one of the slowest available, and even the optional turbocharged engine lags behind some competitors in terms of outright performance. There are also rival sedans that offer nicer interiors and greater degrees of comfort and technology.

A good example is the Kia Forte, which has an extensive list of optional features for a reasonable price. There's also the all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza that has many excellent active safety features and driver aids available. Finally, the Honda Civic, when equipped with its available turbocharged 1.5-liter engine, is our overall favorite vehicle in the class

EDMUNDS REVIEW

I will say Cars.com gives it glowing reviews. U.S. News rates it high but says there are much better cars in this class, with #1 being a Kia Soul.

Car & Driver with 2 1/2 stars had this to say;
The Sentra has a reputation as a reliable ride at an affordable price, but driving fun is lacking. The SR Turbo has more pep, but it can’t completely hide the car’s basic shortcomings. The tall, boxy body rolls in turns, while the steering is too light, and the brakes do not inspire confidence. Numerous options allow you to tailor the Sentra to your tastes, and the back seat is roomy, but the interior design is plain. Infotainment is good, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered.","

My next-door neighbor just had a new steel roof installed.

It wasn't cheap, over $6K, and the 2-man crew had it all done in about 6 hours. They didn't remove the old shingles, just installed wood stringers on top of them and then installed the metal panels to those. Strikes me as a profitable trade.

Perhaps but the competition is going to be tough from the Volvo XC40, Audi Q3, Mercedes Benz GLA, etc.

Personally the XT4 looks more like an entry level luxury SUV than a true luxury vehicle that the Cadillac name suggests. It appears that GM did not try hard enough to differntiate the XT4 from Chevy Equinox or the GMC Terrain. But what do I know about the car biz compared to former Cadillac CEO Johan de Nysschen who conceived this baby. His legacy will live on for the next five years at least.","

The recent spat between Saudi Arabia and our idiot Canadian federal govt politicians that prompted SA to recall all their nationals from Canada uncovered a dirty truth about our university system, at least in the area where I live.

They charge them more, they have no fellowships or scholarships to deal with, and according to their calculations these types of students are hugely profitable, hence the opening up of spots for them.

No more bitter than those (of similar demographics around here) complaining about people getting things for free in terms of the social safety net. You and others definitely sound ""bitter"" about that. Everyone gets something for free, in their own way. That was kind of my point. It might relate to glass houses or something like that IMO, if there is a benefit not remotely attainable by other investors/savers, one supported by another party, it is subsidized. If a fund is not solvent with member contributions, it is subsidized by the someone (the employer, or in more base terms, public funds). I can't think that public sector pensions, which generally provide benefits far better than those available to private sector workers who would make the same contribution, aren't subsidized. How much harder is it for a 25 year old public sector worker saving, vs a private sector worker? When I was 25 and still starting out, I couldn't afford to save as much as I do now, and job security was much less. Maybe it was different in prior generations. I think now, public sector is often 90% of the pay (at the very worst) with 100% of real-time benefits, 200% of the job security (especially after 5-10 years) and 300% of future benefits. This isn't going to end well. In my anecdotal experience, I have no public sector friends who are starving to support a future pension.

I believe this is why the US is going to decline fairly rapidly in the next 20-30 years. We can never hope to attract great people into teaching when we pay them like this.

There is an ad on my Emunds page...a car for iluv....probably about $17000 in the U.S.","I'm reading more and more companies push their ""subscription"" plans for the vehicles. Volvo seems to be in the forefront. Subscription seems to be an essentially all-inclusive leasing program (rental with insurance) with slightly different rules regarding the mileage and more flexible terms on turn-in. What's interesting, they are removing the dealer from price negotiation, probably paying them a flat fee for the transaction. This of course means that if the fee is generous, they will be pushing it hard, if not, you won't see any info there and your salesman will be going deaf every time you mention word subscription.

I don't think this will catch on in the US, unless they pump it with hidden incentives to make the payment attractive enough, which will of course cost them on the back end. Also, the insurance thing is risky, as different people have different protection needs. I've seen manufacturers throwing in insurance packages as incentives in other countries, but those have a very standarized insurance market, i.e. there is only one liability coverage limit, usually something like million bucks, or unlimited, as those nations are not run by trial lawyers.

However, some people may go for it, as ""set it and forget it"" type of a program. I also doubt that ""no price negotiation"" stance will last. Saturn dealers also started as ""no negotiation"" place and by mid 2000s they were just like everybody else.","
Here is my problem. The lady shown as an example of poorly paid teacher makes $69K/year and claims she sometimes can't pay her utility bills. I'm sorry, but something is wrong with this picture. Granted, $69 grand won't buy you a luxury car and home, but it should be plenty to pay a utility bill, even with two children, unless there is an additional hardship, like illness or special care. Unless she bought a house she can't pay for, due to some misguided notion that only a nice house in ""best school neighborhood"" will give her children a chance. It is also possible she felt a need to ""keep up"" with her more financially successful siblings, which can get you in real trouble quite quickly. I don't want to judge, but 79 grand a year is not a fortune, but it's not a poverty level, either. I lived on less than that for at least 10 years. Granted, I don't have children, but I saved a decent portion of my salary, bought a house during that period, and never had credit card debt, not to mention unpaid utility bills. Something does not add up in her story.

BTW, I'm not saying she is paid enough. I'm just saying she should be able to pay her utility bill for that salary.

Paying obscene amounts of money to the entertainers is a separate issue.

All the political and legal hassles will drive people away from becoming police. As for $69K, depends where you live. Probably decent pay in small town Midwest and South, but lousy money in places like Chicago or Seattle. Plus teachers have become de facto babysitters for parents who don't work with their kids.

Consumer Cellular is marketing primarily to the AARP crowd but their service is available to all. We had AT&T before but we were being ripped off at $120 per month for 1GB data, 300 voice minutes and 500 texts. Now we are getting 3+ times the service at 1/3 the price. By the way, Consumer Reports and others have rated Consumer Cellular's service as the best and I'm inclined to agree.","
I've thought about going to Consumer Cellular but as I mentioned last week Mrs. j and I are on Son #1's plan and pay $55 a month for unlimited calls and data for both phones with T Mobile but we both have old Samsung Galaxy 3 phones.

Gotta be a bit careful here because there are multiple ways to calculate market share. If you dollarize it Apple gets an artificial bump because they tend to sell at higher unit prices. Cell phones are like cars and computers, people buy what they personally prefer. There really isn't necessarily one best brand. The Wall Street Journal and several other publications have noted that Apple has a big concern in China. Ironically, although they make a lot of their stuff over there, they are having sales growth and market share issues. They also have pricing issues in places like India. It will be interesting in this market and Europe to see how the aggressive new pricing works out longer term and whether competitors like Samsung follow suit. At some point in the future Apple may face the same issues as Dell and HP did when computers became essentially commodities. The open nature of Android may assist that trend.","bwia said:

Hackers get in all the time, Apple's marketing team is just better than others make you believe your iPhone is unhackable. The password/fingerprint protection is is just one thing. Hackers can get in much easier when you are on the phone checking your email using Wifi, or doing other things. Don't believe the hype, Mike.","Agree with @dino001 - Apple devices are extremely secure, when they're locked. Their memory is encrypted in such a way that makes it very difficult to break through without a PIN/fingerprint or FaceID (if appropriate). However, much that security goes by the wayside once a device is being used - data can be monitored when using unsecured connections, people can still click phishing links, etc.

iPhone is generally better than Android in the sense that it does have a lot of software isolation built-in that helps save people from themselves in terms of inadvertently installing malware - Apps are limited to what they can see, what they can access etc, and the App Store is heavily regulated.","iPhones are the Prius/Tesla of the phone world, there, I said it.

Once that happened I moved into the iPhone world and haven't looked back. Also cringing at the prices, too.

Living in Seattle, we switched to T-Mobile from the Deathstar after device payment plans got messed up and several months of billing. Haven't looked back since - and actually just moved to T-Mobile One Plus plan thanks to my employee discount.

T-Mobile is the way forward around here, I think - coverage is fine and prices are the most competitive. This being the home base, I think they might ensure the service works best. They are also I think the pioneer in device leasing, where you can change your phone a couple times a year if you want.

","At the beginning of this decade, when I traveled, I lugged around a DSLR, as phone pics could be embarrassing, and I never had good luck with a small camera.

That was when they were pretty much the only game in town. I never liked them much, found them extremely non-intuitive and difficult to use.

Thankfully it broke within 2 years and by then my employer had brought iPhones into their system. Night and day, I liked it immediately. Everything just worked. Then I got an iPad for work also and started using iTunes for a music library. I'm quite satisfied and see no reason to change.

I'm sure the Android devices are fine, sort of, aside from the periodic fires and explosions and hardware failures. But I can't see paying Apple money for a Samsung or LG device. Plus I never cared for the cutesy names of the OS releases. Seems very hackable and quite do-it-yourself too.","
Actually, your camera just happens to also be capable of acting as a phone and internet access point. Camera function seems to be a major differentiator of those devices these days.","I'm a ""late adopter"" by nature. Never rush to buy a new thing, especially completely new technology. Part of it is avoiding ""gateway"" devices when spending on one opens you to spend on bunch of other stuff just to make it work. My first Apple device was Nano, 4th generation. My first cell phone was a prepaid Samsung flip phone that I got to stay in touch with my visiting parents as we were meeting away from my home. It was late 2000s (I had no cell phone till then and I was happy). A few years later I got iPad4. Kept upgrading it every two generations (Air 2, last gen), handing down the old one to my folks in Poland. Still kept my flip phone for number of years and would have for a bit longer if not for a fact our office moved and there was no signal in the new building, eating the battery due to constant search. So I switch to AT&T, also prepaid with some cheap phone. That one had truly poor reception (even though the network was strong enough), so I decided finally I was ready for an iPhone - it was 2015. It was also time, when Verizon finally unlocked and unbundled the plans from the phones, which was what I wanted the most (iPhone 6). Upgraded it to the ""seven"" less than two years later, only because my nephew wanted my old one. I may do it again, this time handing my ""seven"" to my sister or mother. Or maybe not. Will see. Still keeping a ""skinny"" plan with 2GB of data, usually not using more than 1 GB in a month. I might use more on occasion, but most of my activities are on Wifi, at home or at work.

BTW, on the late adopter thing. It was only once, when I bought something relative early. It was HD-DVD player, as Costco put it on sale for something like $299, down from $499, or something like that. Looked like a bargain and it still had a major support at that time. Three months later Warner Bros. (Disney) declared to go exclusively with Blueray. Universal had no choice, but to switch at that point (they were the only one left). Three months later from that (or so), Neflix discontinued HD-DVD format on their subscription. Some bargain I got. Looks like it was a last ditch effort from Toshiba to put the players into hands of the users. Even though they were cheaper than Blueray all the way down, it didn't work. The users somehow believed Blueray was superior (full 1080p) in spite of HD-DVD supporting same resolution, but the problem was first releases were in 1080i/720p and it registered in peoples' heads. So my almost new player became a collector's item in six months after purchase.","
They seem to be very good at helping people walk backwards over cliffs, too, or video taping somebody bleeding to death in the street.

Nailed it","Two friends and I were sitting on their porch a few months back. One was talking about how little he spends for his Iphone. It's not the most recent. He was bragging about how he could do this and that with it. I pointed out I do the same with 3-4 year old technology in my Android (LG L41c). Then he mentioned something else his iphone does. Same for my Android. And a couple more things were compared. He seemed stunned his Apple product was not uniquely advanced compared to Android.

Back to the Prious/Tesla moment.

I suspect, other than Apple's restricting ability to improve on the actual box you own as a phone with additional apps, the two are comparable in service.

Let me say this - I grew up on PC, never had a Mac and most likely never will. Just too expensive, period. However, once the technology matured, I did get iPhone and iPad. I like them, I don't love them. It's technology, there is nothing to ""love"". It works, it's useful. Apple's way of making money on some things (like memory upgrades, cheap 5W charger but advertising fast charging capability, no jack adapter in the new models) is just shameless and I sometimes hope people rebel for just a day or a few months, so they stop treating their customers like cows to milk. Their marketing is all about evoking positive feeling while providing as little actual detail as possible. However, the most annoying part of their marketing is, when they come with a feature that was already present on competitive products, sometimes for years, they act like it's an incredible breakthrough, nobody on this Planet ever thought of before genius Apple engineers. If you didn't know, they'd make you believe they invented photography (or at least ""reinvented""), not to mention inductive charging, or wireless headphones. It's truly insulting at times. We all can understand ""truthful exaggeration"" from commercials, or politics, as a part of salesman's toolkit, but there are limits to the insult of our intelligence. But, I guess I'm a hostage - I still buy it, regardless. Stockholm syndrome, anyone?","OK, one thing Apple is superior to Android - updates. You buy a flagship Samsung or LG, you may get timely updates. You buy a midlevel phone, also from Samsung, still paying $300, or more - they abandon you the same day, or within a year, not even pretending to care about you. This makes you vulnerable to an attack, as older versions of Android have better recognized exploits and gaps. Apple will get you update for years. I don't buy people saying they'll make it slow on purpose. What's more likely, people use new features on the older machines and not understand it takes more power. Also, the websites, or apps get more complex and require more power to run. I know people with older phones and they're fine with updates, as long as they stay careful about loading up their machines, they're usually fine.","I like that when traveling my phone, email and camera are all in one device. You can walk backwards off a cliff with a camera too. But most people don’t. I also sync across all my devices, as I prefer to read or work on my iPad or laptop. The usefulness of these devices really came into sharp relief when I had my somewhat unexpected transplant. M Suddenly we find ourselves in the hospital for 8 days, 100 miles from home. Emailing students, arranging for people to care for our animals, and even a few pics to send as updates to our caring friends. All possible because of the smartphone. Some people prefer Android systems. Having had both, Apple works best for me."

A well-managed pension is a good thing to look for when making decisions about a career. It is one of several factors that need to be considered. I don't need to tell you that. BTW your characterization of employer participation in funding a pension is at odds with the very definition of the term. Without employee participation, it is not a pension, it is a retirement savings account. Just like taking vacation time without it being allowed by the employer is being AWOL from work.

I can only speak to what happens where I live. I have read about police chiefs in certain US cities making $1 million annually which if so is lunacy. But here the public sector was not paid well for a very long time. Until about 15 years ago a Deputy Minister (think CEO) of a government agency didn't make $100K a year. That has now changed but most of them here still don't make $200K a year in worthless Canadian dollars. There has been some creep upward in the levels below that but still nothing too spectacular. My former boss who is the CEO of a $600 million a year retailer makes $230K. In Ontario that same job (on a scale several times as large) makes 3 times that. In Alberta the private sector guy who is most equivalent in terms of business size makes over a million a year. But he may not have a pension and can get fired at any time by a vote of the Board of Directors. You pays your money and makes your choice.

A fund to help cushion the landing of someone who loses their job unexpectedly is a good thing. I think we can agree on that. A career choice that depends upon receiving that benefit every year for months at a time for 35 years may test the patience of even the most ""progressive"" of taxpayers.

If a given employer (usually in a certain sector) supports a pension fund far more than the matching given by a private sector firm (and many do little or nothing), it is a subsidy, made more glaring via it being propped up by people who themselves will never be able to have such a jackpot when it comes time to retire - if they are even able to do so to begin with. There's not much chance of anyone I know in the private sector being able to have 80%+++ of their highest salary for the rest of their lives, with COLAs, along with other bennies, with such a contribution.

I know public sector compensation issues only from a few friends and family, so it is quite anecdotal. But none of them I know are having issues making ends meet, and virtually all of them are relatively unfireable after a certain amount of time on the job, usually no more than a decade. Some of those public sector vs private sector leadership titles are also a bit different in terms of responsibility - there's not a lot of bottom line to deal with when you're presiding over a virtual monopoly. It may be the equivalent of a CEO on an org chart, but maybe not in terms of accountability, or what it to get there (and this is coming from someone who also thinks private sector execs are grossly overcompensated - and the historic worker to CEO pay ratios in the US supports that, compared to places with less of a chasm).

Regarding the difference in UI vs careers, maybe the idea of certain careers contributing more for such insurance would help, just as it costs more for an 18 year old to insure a Corvette than it does for a 70 year old to insure an Avalon.
","Executive rewards are even more insane than the craziest public sector windfalls - I won't disagree with you there.

My employer matches 5%, and I feel lucky to have that. Many aren't so lucky, if they get any matching at all. And then some have impressively generous guaranteed bennies with no worries about running out of funds, in part subsidized by those who couldn't dream of such security. This can't end well.

I find it amusing that exec to worker pay ratios are not uniform across developed economies.
",Maybe agree to disagree and move on?,"
You seem to be making this into a similar sort of discussion as those on here regarding speeding.

You either do not understand the word subsidy or you are deliberately misusing it. A pension is simply another employee benefit. Typically public sector wages were lower, often far lower, than equivalents in the private sector and so some of those other things you mention were instituted to offset that to an extent although to younger workers they didn't mean much. When the tech boom really hit 20 years ago it became almost impossible for govts here to hire IT people because of the wage disparity. Some private sector employees have their country club memberships subsidized. Some get cars to use. Some can expense a great deal. The list goes on. None of those things would be true for most public sector employees. The grass always seems greener, I suppose. In terms of what the specific terms of the pension may be, those are typically limited by law in terms of eligible amounts of annual salary, % included in the calculation, years of service and the like. If they get too rich the fund becomes insolvent. That's why it is important to have good fund management.

Public sector management is indeed quite different from private sector. When I worked in govt it was virtually impossible to fire someone, especially when they were in the union. While there were some good performers and hard workers, the majority were just OK, and there were some who had no business being there but you could not get rid of them, so they kept getting shuffled around until they could retire. Performance reviews were a useless exercise and accountability was only a word that had little actual meaning. The same symptoms affected top management, some of whom were appointed because of their skill at manipulating the political decision makers, not their management skills. Others made their name at coming up with policy initiatives or being technocrats but never had to manage more than a handful of folks and also lacked financial skills. When the inevitable disasters happened on their watch it was no surprise. This is in large part why Canada, which loves big government and has a seeming majority who want even more government services provided, cannot effectively deliver the public services currently in place. The mismanagement, inefficiency and waste is a sight to behold, and the bureaucracy effectively prevents any meaningful reform.","

In 1968 I was making $1.65/hr. and you could buy about 4.7 gallons of gas for one hour of work. Today I make $10.40/hr. and you can only get 3.7 gallons for that. However, the cars today get 30 mpg vs 15 so your relative cost per mile is less.

As to used cars, I paid $1500 for my 69 Plymouth and $2k for my 2000 Chrysler. The 69 was newer at the time but the Chrysler will probably outlast the Plymouth in terms of trouble free miles.

I agree that public sector pensions are overly generous especially since, at least in my state, public employees are making substantially more than private.

But it's not all roses. The school I worked at had such a Byzantine set of retirement rules that I was denied exit bonuses, health insurance and other benefits that were supposedly due me. If a private employer pulled that the state AG would sue them.","You'll never solve the public private argument. I think it has gone on for years. If you look close, the pro gov tend to not fully price in the benefits, while the anti gov tend to ignore things like private side bonuses and stock plans. If I had to guess, I'd think the private side compensates better for professionals and executives, while the public may be a better deal for admin types. I also think it is hard to use total workforce comparisons because I don't think the gov side has as big a proportion of blue collar as the private in many cases. Bottom line, neither side will ever win this debate.

Running your own business or farm; I think it is ridiculous that those people often have to hire a tax accountant on top of everything else.

Here is a picture of the bottom of the deck stairs.","I was extremely lucky for a long while and had a company that matched our 401Ks @ 50 cents on the dollar up to a 10% employee contribution. This really helped mine build up quickly.

Many things got much worse at Honeywell over the past five years, which is why I'm now retired. Lots of outsourcing to India for analysis and computer work, with manufacturing moved from Phoenix to 'Chihuahua and the Czech Republic. Either way, my 401K benefitted greatly from the matching policy, and my 38 years of continuous service netted me a defined benefit pension as well. Things are significantly more challenging today at the entry level, no doubt -- timing (luck) is everything. I started at AiResearch in 1968, so had 50 years with the company, albeit with an 8-year hiatus to do teaching, truck driving and electronic sales. This retirement thing is a definite adjustment, but a good one.","Indeed, I would like to see credible independent numbers about real upward wage pressure.

I am grateful I usually get a yearly increase, but the cost of living likes to chip away as much of that as possible. That I live in an area where the lucky ones were able to buy houses for 75K in 1983 that can now be worth 1MM or more doesn't help, as salaries definitely haven't nearly paced housing (or education, or medical) costs.
","That was barely over minimum wage too, I assume you were young and didn't have as many obligations as you would later, or even now. $1.60 in 1968 adjusts to over $11 today, while the federal minimum wage is far below that - fortunately, many states have taken matters into their own hands, without the economic catastrophe predicted by some.

School costs more than double now than it did when I was a student in the late 90s. Most wages haven't followed.

Around here, the smart money would have been in housing. It would have been very easy to buy a 30K (not the cheapest but not a mansion) house in some areas around Seattle in 1968 and have a healthy 7 figures now.

Regarding the public sector stuff, I bet some of the seventy-leven levels of management and archaic organizations are amazing in NY, especially NYC.
","And you keep replying

If a benefit is being kept afloat by massive distant party inputs, especially those far in excess of most of those technically providing the funding, I will call it subsidized. When there's no way nearly any private sector employee would be able to earn the return gained by a public sector pensioner, I will call it subsidized. It doesn't seem to disagree with any definition I can find.

I have friends who are in non-union (as far as I know) public sector management roles, and are still virtually unfireable, simply due to policies around tenure. That's a hell of a perk that I can easily counter with if one mentions a minor salary difference. I won't judge their performance - they aren't lazy or inept, but oftentimes private sector cuts just don't target bad workers either. I am generally a fan of social goods, but not so much a fan of two tier or two class systems.

Speaking of Canada, I know BC has a gigantic and not terribly efficient public sector, it'll be interesting to see what happens with taxes there to keep it going, or when a large group from that sector retires. Going to have to tax the money laundering in local real estate even more.

Bonds and compounding interest are a key aspect of pension/retirement savings, not just stocks. This has helped stocks for now, but as all that personal and corporate leverage gets hit with rising rates down the road something will have to give.

Everyone who doesn't work under the table pays into an unemployment insurance system here, too. Many people will never use it. Some people abuse it. Some will be saved by it when the need arises.

Not to my knowledge. The employer contributed a matching amount like most pensions plans require.

Tax levels here in the USA are often higher in actuality than what people believe. As a self-employed contractor, I pay 5.6% social security, plus another 5.6% (the part your employer usually pays), plus 2.6% for medicare. That's 15.2% BEFORE you even get into FICA (income tax). I hold back 36% of every dollar earned and send it to the government quarterly.

I wouldn't mind living in a country with higher taxation who actually does more for it's citizens (Canada, for example).

All in all, though, I'm happy with where I'm at, and how I'm doing. I could be a heck of a lot worse off.","Taxes between places is really hard to compare because as you noted the gov return varies. Also there are the allowable write-offs, inflection points where rate changes kick in, etc. Scandinavians have some of the higher taxes, yet are some of the happiest citizens.","
The interest rates were held artificially low for political purposes cause it made the interest overhead on the debt load lower than if interest rates had risen naturally. Also spending the QE monies went directly into the pockets of the friends in the stock market and banking industry.

Now that rates are being allowed to adjust and we aren't dumping QE monies out of tax funds, the increase in tax collections from the greatly improved economy will help the interest rates give returns for people and retirement systems wanting dependable income without risking monies in the stock and other markets to as great a degree. The low interest rates hurt older and retired people most.","And that matching amount is the subsidy. I suspect it is more than the typical 401K casino match in the states. The way it operates in Murka makes for a definite two class system in terms of retirement benefits, where private sector workers could never dream of the payouts (or medical coverage) enjoyed by the public sector. I can't wait to see what happens to social security in another 25 or so years when my demographic counterparts and I will be eligible. They'll probably bump up the age to 70-75 and lower benefits. We'll probably still have the same backwards medical care scheme then, too.

I looked around, and the best deal I could find for a new key fob was Batteries Plus. $180 all in, including sales tax, so I did the deal, they charged my credit card immediately, sent me an email saying they would let me know when I pick up my key fob and have it programmed.

This morning, two days later, I get an email saying that the local store has “declined” my order. WTH?? I called the local store, they do not answer the phone, so I leave a voice mail. That was about 4 hours ago, and they haven’t called back. I have called Amex and contested the charge, gone on Yelp and gave them a really really negative review. In the meantime, I have been calling around. One locksmith (the one recommended by Angie’s List) quoted $280. When I told him that was more than the dealer, he replied, “We charge more for the convenience.” Yeah, right, goodbye.’

Finally found a locksmith who was willing to do the job for $195, all in, if I could come to them and pay cash. Except they can’t do it today, booked up, call back on Monday.

Any young people out there looking for a lucrative income without 4 or more years of college, I can definitely recommend locksmithing.","
You sound bitter.

Employer matching is hardly a ""subsidy"". It is a benefit like dental care or vacation time or any other employee benefit. I can tell you that for the first part of may career I certainly didn't see it that way. ""Why is all this money deducted every paycheck from my take-home?"" was a typical complaint. That was particularly hard to swallow in the early years when you were just getting started and money was tight. It's hard to appreciate the value of a retirement pension when you are in your 20s. The argument that was made to me back then was that it was a trade-off - I could make a lot more in the private sector, but the pension and benefits were usually not as good and job security wasn't great. I know lots of people who left government jobs for the private sector pot of gold. It's simply a choice one needs to make.

Now you may have a valid gripe against companies in the private sector no longer offering pension plans as was once typical for larger operations. And it is also true that mismanagement of a lot of pension plans both public and private caused a lot of problems. But let's be clear - when you look at the way investment funds have grown over the last 20-30 years, even with the periodic corrections in the market, a decently-managed pension plan should have no difficulty being sustainable long-term.","

Agreed. When I take office On January 1, 2019 the state will take 5% of my salary, ""match"" it with 4% and stick it into a pension fund. I can't opt out, and believe me I wish I could; I'd make more money long term investing that 5% myself...","If it were not for my pension, I could never have retired at age 65.  IIRC, when I was in Illinois, 8-1/2% of every penny I earned went toward my pension.  I always worked a 221 day contract (full time including June, July and August) as a teacher and principal.  I worked in a year-round school district.  Unfortunately, even though i paid 8.5% into the pension throughout the year, I only got credit for a 9 month contract.  So I contributed many, many thousands of dollars more to the state pension fund that 95% of the teachers in the state - but only got credit for a regular school year.","

I worked for a private college and we had employer matching too, as do many non-profits. You only get as large a match as you are able to put in, and in our early years that was not very much!","I also believe the employer max is capped by tax law, just like the individual's contributions. Why can't they just do what they want? I think beyond the max cap it becomes taxable to the employee.","No more bitter than those (of similar demographics around here) complaining about people getting things for free in terms of the social safety net. You and others definitely sound ""bitter"" about that. Everyone gets something for free, in their own way. That was kind of my point. It might relate to glass houses or something like that

IMO, if there is a benefit not remotely attainable by other investors/savers, one supported by another party, it is subsidized. If a fund is not solvent with member contributions, it is subsidized by the someone (the employer, or in more base terms, public funds). I can't think that public sector pensions, which generally provide benefits far better than those available to private sector workers who would make the same contribution, aren't subsidized. How much harder is it for a 25 year old public sector worker saving, vs a private sector worker? When I was 25 and still starting out, I couldn't afford to save as much as I do now, and job security was much less.

Maybe it was different in prior generations. I think now, public sector is often 90% of the pay (at the very worst) with 100% of real-time benefits, 200% of the job security (especially after 5-10 years) and 300% of future benefits. This isn't going to end well. In my anecdotal experience, I have no public sector friends who are starving to support a future pension.

","Another factor is the rising increase in executive compensation ratio compared to the worker's pay. I hope Mr. Fintail also notices the executives are well taken care of in companies while the workers who actually do the jobs as compensated without defined pension plans when possible and are told they can contribute to 401k plans as their retirement plans, sometimes with a setup to match may 3-5% of their pay if the employee contributes appropriate amounts.

The same executive pay ratios compared to the workers in the same company have gone higher and higher since I started noticing in the 70s when I started investing. That excess compensation could be used to improve workers pension security.","My wife is claustrophobic about MRI's. She had been having the ""open"" type which doens't have resolution that's as good as the tube kind. Ortho doctor said their new office has the largest in the area. I think the diameter of the tube is almost larger than the distance between the ""buns"" on the open MRI. With 5mg valium she was able to do this one. Plus she covers her eyes with a light towel or washcloth. So I'll share another of the roadside signs.

Thanks!  I’ll look into that.  The big problem with my beautiful back yard is the extremely high water tables.  Dig down not that far and it is just all clay that literally never dries.  It gets very wet back there after even a mild storm.  I had the contractor’s landscaper put grey stones underneath the deck because the grass was going to die anyway.  I was thinking of having it done towards the driveway too.  Thoughts?","@nyccarguy,
My back yard is very similar in that we have a high water table, too.
Difference is, my house has a true walkout basement.
This picture will provide some perspective with snow.","I just got a new iPhone 8 Plus last month but got it at a very good price from ""OfferUp"", an app where folks near me sell stuff they want to get rid of. I've bought a few items on there with excellent results so I went for the new 8 Plus also. Works great and just got a Samsung Fast Charger because it has the new Qi technology. Great battery life and a home button.
Finally wiped clean my 6s Plus yesterday, the one with the newer battery, and will either sell it on the same website, try a phone store/pawn shop or just give it to the wife if she wants to change from her Android smartphone which doesn't have much storage.
Another reason I upgraded was to get more storage, had 32 gigs but wanted 64, which I now have. So I'm set for another couple of years. Have no problem getting a year old unit and paying a fraction of the price for brand new. Works for me.

She put my sim card in the new one and I was up and running. Moved the contacts and with help from Apple, got the iTunes account moved also.

When I lived in my first house, the back yard was one step down from the kitchen and dining room so in the mid 70's I poured a 12 by 20 foot concrete patio. Never had to do any maintenance.

The railings and spindles (anything White) is a product called Azec.  It is recycled plastic that is very durable and virtually maintenance free.

They are generally in line with other flagships and wannabes (at least on the list price level). However, charging $150 and $350 extra those higher storage models is a true highway robbery with an insult for good bye. Those things cost Apple probably somewhere around 10 bucks, maybe a little more. I just saw Best Buy 1 TB (!) solid state drive sale for less than $200 (starting list price was of course around $400, still not a fortune, considering how much those things used to cost). That includes the board, case, connectors, box and cost of retailing the item (imagine volume discounts on that).

Apple is charging same price on storage upgrades, as they did when those NaND chips cost 10 times as they do today. That is truly insulting to its customers, but they get away with that.

Not sure what you mean by unusable. My mother is still using my old iPhone 6 and it's just fine for her. She didn't even change that battery, something I may actually take care when she comes and visits me. The software is showing the battery is still fine. The whole slowing down issue was more public relations problem than actual issue. Apple made a change to protect the phones from powering down when battery is weak and the demand is spiking. The problem is they only told that once in the update description that nobody, reads of course. So, to console the angry mob, they offered cheap battery replacement. I bet it will expire and they will not extend it. I think they should, but they are used to charging people whatever pops to their heads and getting away with it, so why should they suddenly volunteer charging less (see my post above about the NaND chips)?","

My 4-month LG dishwasher stopped working. The guy came and opened it, it's the control circuit board. OK, happens, not great, but those things somethings burn out in their early usage. That's what warranties are for.

However, as he was opening the control compartment, the guy mentioned that those dishwashers with top control panels often short, as water can enter there from the spills on the counter. Mine was clean inside, so no water - however, I discovered the compartment, where all the electronics are placed is NOT SEALED!!!. This is ridiculous. So there is seal and protection from water inside the dishwasher, but when it comes to counter spills, you are completely on your own. Considering most dishwashers are positioned next to the sink, this is totally outrageous.

I'm sure it's not unique to LG, I'm sure everybody does that. As the guy said, the issue is common to all those with top controls, which today is majority, as they are considered better fashion than front controlled, why I don't know I guess women of the house decided that's nicer. So all of those better ones, with more features also come with controls up top.

Speaking as an ex-social worker the question of who is the ""deserving poor"" has been debated for over a hundred years. I personally raised a family, built a house and saved money for the kids' education while making as little as $12k a year. We never took free lunches even though the income limit was $70,000.

How did we do it? As Fintail suggested, we worked three jobs and bootstrapped it.. Didn't take vacations and drove junkers. Was it easy? Heck no. But our kids never went hungry, always had school supplies and I hope learned the value of work. I'm not saying that some folks don't need the help but some are using a system designed by corrupt vote buying politicians to get a freed ride.

The problem is that there is no easy way to weed out deserving and undeserving people.","

As the south suburbs of Chicago is the farthest south I have ever spent a winter and I routinely keep cars 10 years or longer I can honestly say I have never needed to replace brake lines.

The N55 motor in the M240i is rated at 335 hp. The new M2 Competition does have 405 hp.
The M240i has a bit longer gearing than the M235i, so the M240i doesn't pull ahead until around 70 mph- it winds up being a half second faster to 100 mph.

If I went with another 2er I'd order it so I could delete the sunroof. An M2 or M2C is much less likely to have a hole in the roof, so I will probably go CPO.","

That's a lot of money to replace a fuel tank. I replaced a few gas tanks when I was younger, they tended to rust out before the rest of the car. This being in Texas, no salt. It was pretty easy 40 or 50 years ago to swap out a gas tank. The last time I dropped one was on a 1984 Ford F150, to replace the sender for the fuel gauge, and that was relatively easy, half a day.

It seems that many (most?) newer cars have the fuel pump in the gas tank, high pressure gas lines, evaporative
control systems, all kinds of things to make the job harder and more expensive. Oh, well. (big sigh)","
I did that too — oh wait, that was in 1979. Gas was less than a dollar a gallon, you could get a decent used car for a few hundred $$, and my first house cost less than my car today. What you could do back then can’t be done for the same amount as now. The working poor do all the things you say. They just have to have more $ to make ends meet because everything costs more. That’s why the poverty line is higher.","

These people are very obviously not used to life in the big city.

Back around 2002 or 2003, we had a big fifth wheel travel trailer, which we pulled with a big Ford diesel F250. Anyone familiar with big heavy travel trailers will tell you that they tend to eat tires. Blowing out tires is just part of the overhead. Whenever I set out on a trip, I always had at least two spares.

One day I’m driving down a 2 lane state highway, no real shoulders, and blow out one of the tires on the travel trailer. We were just coming in to a small town, right there in front of me was a funeral home, with a nice big empty parking lot. I figure 10 minutes to jack up the trailer and swap the tire, no big deal. I was quite practiced at swapping tires on that rig. So I pull into the parking lot, taking up a great deal of space, and start doing my thing.

No sooner do I have the rig up on the jack, and cars start pulling in. One after the other, a solid stream. Apparently they had a service of some kind, or a viewing, or something, scheduled for 5:00 p.m., and I parked in their parking lot at 4:55. Being a small town, everyone living close by, they all show up at the same time, at the last minute. The director or head man or whatever comes out and asks me politely if I can move. I tell him, “Man, I’m really sorry, I had no idea. I’m working as fast as I can, I will be out of here in 5 minutes.”

It was really very embarrassing, one of those things you don’t forget.","

Where's your sense of adventure. Couldn't you use the parking brake/emergency brake or the low gears to get to a stop when needed? That's what we did out in the rural country long ago when brakes failed. LOL","Got home about an hour ago from my trip.  As I was approaching my parking space, I noticed the entire parking lot was filled with cars, including my parking space and all the guest spaces.  So I parked perpendicular behind the car that was in my spot and called security.

About 5 minutes later, a security cop arrived in his squad car.  I explained the problem to him.  He said a lady in one of our condo units had passed away last Friday and the reason every parking space was occupied was because the family was receiving guests after the funeral this morning.  I asked him where I should park my car until he could determine whose car it was so it could be moved.  He suggested I park in the main guest parking lot 4 blocks away.

Just as I was about to pull my car from behind the vehicle in my reserved spot, one of the mourners visiting came over and said it would be 6 hours before the car would be moved - the ending time for visitors to the family.  I asked that the car be moved NOW because I just returned from a 5 hour trip from Jacksonville and was in no condition to walk 4 blocks to park my car.

The guy looks at me and says, “...sue me!”  The security officer insisted that the car be moved immediately.  This guy told the security officer to f...off!  Now, five more mourners come down to the parking lot and started cursing me out because I had called security on them.

This did not end peacefully!  The man who owned the car finally moved it and said I was an insensitive SOB.  Further, that I had some nerve causing this confrontation during visitation of the mourners.

I tell you - I have no luck in this world - all I did was call security - I didn’t know someone had died.  And even so, I had no place to park and I was exhausted from the long drive.  My parking spot is my property and states so in my deed and homeowners association contract.

Now I’ll have a ghost haunting me for wanting to park in my own space.  I give up! ","
You're right about that but that's the price you pay when you cheat like @roadburner is doing and taking his car to a shop.

Back in the mid 70's I had to replace a brake line on my '68 Olds and called the dealer to have all of them replaced. The price was out of sight so I asked about having just the rusted out line replaced just to get the car back on the road. My plan was to do the rest myself at my convenience. Of course that would not have cost nearly as much but the dealer couldn't get me into the shop for 3 days and an independent shop couldn't get me in for 2 days. That was better but not good enough so I went to the parts store and bought the premade lines in the lengths as close to what I needed but a little longer. I wanted to cut the lines that were too long and buy the double flare tool and remake that end but no one had it so I had to ""hide"" the extra length as best as I could. I did that by bending the line that went from the master cylinder to the ""T"" mounted on the differential unit in a sine wave in a few places to take up about 5 or 6 extra inches. I lucked out with the lines that ran along the rear axle from the ""T"" to the rear brake cylinders because they were only about 1 inch too long. Took me the better part of a Saturday evening but I never had a problem. The car always stopped just like it was supposed to do.

I don't plan to ever do that again but it was a good experience.

She actually created a GoFundMe page asking for money to pay for the cat's veterinarian treatment. I could not believe it.

New potential new ride's stock Nissan wheels.



I am fine with the black but I also like the other wheel Nissan chose to install that has silver accent ""slats"" coming in with a slant-fair with the widest spot of silver being at the outside of the wheels.","Saw that the average price for a used car is almost $20,000 now and the average monthly payment on a used car is now $378.

I can see how higher prices on new vehicles might create more demand and drive up prices on used inventory. But that high a monthly payment almost has to be related to people rolling over remaining amounts on loans and carrying more debt.

Most I've ever spent on a new car was for our 2014 Versa Note and that was barely over $15K. Likewise, my payments on the Note were $288.

I get the distinct impression that I'm nowhere near the norm when it comes to piling up debt",Looks nice in blue. I also prefer those wheels.,"
$378 looks about right for a $20k car plus TTL, assuming little down. Because used buyers at that price are probably still financing out as far as new car buyers. 5 years on a brand new car, with a good rate, is OK to me, but no way I am doing that on a 3 YO one.

I actually use a 5 year look back rule. New car can go 5, then sliding scale to 5YO needs to be cash. So 3 YO car could do 2 years. This also roughly overlays the warranty period (at least powertrain).","PF_Flyer said:

You're pretty much the norm here except for the price of the car. A $288 payment on a $15k car is comparable to a $378 payment on  $20k car presuming identical interest rate, taxes, doc fees and down payment (as a percentage of total sales price).","I get the distinct impression that I'm nowhere near the norm when it comes to piling up debt


And that is something that attracts people like us to Nissan purchases - good value for the money. After doing all the research on this car I think that Nissan is one of the leaders in that category.

As I've been researching potential trade-in possibilities I considered the Nissan Versa Note briefly. I think it would be fun to drive but I've decided to go with the Sentra SR Turbo for more power and economy. The Sentra SR Turbo gets 37mpg on the highway and 30 in the city. More than acceptable to me.","

Texting vs leaving a voice mail message -- depends entirely on whom you're trying to communicate with. Most of the younger generation will never actually listen to a voice mail. They will notice the missed call, call me back, and say something like, ""I saw your call, what's up?"" Whereas if I send a text saying, ""I need you to send me the address for cousin Brucie"", I will get a text reply with the address.

And to all of you who say you don't have and don't need a smart phone -- have you ever seriously considered the benefits of having the internet available as you move around? You're in the auto parts store, and they want $200 for a pair of brake rotors, a quick check on RockAuto or Amazon, and you can get them for half that price. You're in WalMart, and they have a 40"" LED TV for $199. Is that a good price? 30 seconds on your smart phone, and you know if it is. You're in some strange locale, where you've never been before, you're in a rent car with no NAV, and you're lost. Whip out your smart phone, 30 seconds later you're back on track. Anyone selling good Italian food within 10 miles? Bingo.

The second was interesting in that I had never seen one before and had to ask the owner about. Turns out it was a blue-coated Australian Cattle Dog, quite interesting looking. Apparently they like to herd things including groups of small children, and are quite protective of their owners.","

When I was young, parents would not have been so anxious as these people are to solicit and accept this type of charity. I know my parents would have been mortified if anyone thought they couldn't afford to buy school supplies and clothes. Where is our pride these days?

It probably sounds cold, but whatever happened to supporting your family? If you can't afford to take care of children, don't have them. I just don't remember this level of charity begging when I was younger.

I don't know if I've got the energy to do it today, I got up early, called the hospital Education Dept. to sign up for a BLS class, then called the Overhead Garage Door Company of Alamogordo to get an estimate. Good news: the service call was only $70 and the whole bill is going to only run about $100. I asked the young man to have the Office Manager send the bill to our mailing address. Our automatic garage door opener broke in a few places. I don't have the needed tools to fix it so I called them for help. The young man that fixed it is moving to Seattle in a couple months.

I have some strong views on religion. I will say this about the subject.

He apologized to Mrs D ""because it must be upsetting for her, ""because she has to put up with me when I am angry - I am sorry driver got mad"".

I am thinking of driving the 461 miles west to Phoenix tomorrow and test-driving a 2017 model SR in Red Alert color. This car is head and shoulders above the basic 'S' model Sentra it isn't funny. It has heated leather seats, a sunroof, leather gearshift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, blue stitching in various parts of the interior, Bose 6-speaker stereo in which Gold Pony states the bass is great on, NAV seems to be included, you can integrate your phone through Bluetooth I'm assuming, so you can use YouTube or Google off your phone. That sounds like Android Auto but it's not called that - I'll have to check that out! I like that feature a lot. The lip spoiler with the thin strip of lighting that comes on in the rear when you hit the brakes. Push button start, key fob that allows you to just have your key in your pocket when you get close to your car, ample rear legroom, etc. This car isn't missing anything I'd want in a sporty car - it reminds me a lot of my 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS quite a bit - I think psychologically I'm trying to get back to that car through this one. We'll see which one I like the most.

The video after this one that I'm watching right now mentions that the 2017-19 Sentra SR Turbo model is Nissan's first turbo-charged engine? What? He must mean it's the Sentra model's first turbo-charged engine. Nissan engineers pulled the engine outta the Juke for this Sentra SR Turbo. 0-60mph in 7.2 seconds IIRC the numbers correctly.

He had trouble getting to Montgomery last year because of Hurricane Irma. He might end up driving home unless Florence stays further south than the predicted stall area.

I wonder about Monroe who used to be on here who lives in Lumberton, NC. They had floods a few back. Florence stalling out will really flood them. Later today I'm calling my friends who moved into upstate SC to see if they have their ark built yet."

I wonder if the word “coward” was derived from a cowboy deliberately shooting a helpless “cow” with his Colt .45 while leaning “forward” in his saddle.  

Back in in those days (1860’s) shooting animals was as common as shooting humans.

So when you mentioned “...only cowards do that stuff...” I put 2 and 2 together and came up with “cow shooters”! 
By 1860's I suspect you mean the Civil War. If not back in the old west shooting humans was rather uncommon.
I don’t know about that - I got my info from watching “High Noon”, “Rio Lobo”, “Wagon Train”, “Paladin”, “How The West Was Won”, “The Rifleman”, “Shane”, and many more factual data I accumulated in my brain over the years.

Yeah you were more likely to die of boredom than if a bullet back then. The famous Lincoln County War lasted over 3 years but only resulted in 21 deaths. It really wasn't what Hollywood portrays, but reality was rather boring.

Pearse says Travelers calculates gap insurance premiums at roughly 5 percent to 6 percent of the premium for collision and comprehensive insurance you have on the car. On a $1,400 annual premium — with $420 to $560 of that typically for collision and comprehensive — gap insurance would cost $20 to $30. And the cost goes down along with the cost of collision and comprehensive as the vehicle ages
.

great info henryn. Mine cost about 5% when I had the 2015, now closer to 7 or 8% of cost of the premium. But, nice to have on a $72000 car, that probably would have been worth $55000 at the time of the accident, and the new one was closeer to almost $80k. I would have had to come up with $25000 difference!","

President Donald Trump offered some business advice to Ford Motor on Sunday: because of the administration's high tariffs on car imports from China, Ford can start making its Focus Active in the United States.

Breaking financial news from Ford: they tell Trump why they can't build their Focus Active in the U.S.


""It would not be profitable to build the Focus Active in the U.S. given an expected annual sales volume of fewer than 50,000 units,"" Ford said Sunday.

The statement came after Trump tweeted about an article from August 31, when Ford announced that it was canceling plans to make the Focus Active, a compact crossover, in China and ship them to the United States.

Allright, Don. Easy enough mistake ta make.

""This is just the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs!"" Trump wrote, citing a Reuters article posted on CNBC.

The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, including some automobiles, in a move Trump has touted as necessary to punish Beijing for what he says are its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. China has retaliated in kind, and Washington and Beijing have continue to ratchet up threats of more tariffs.

Ford spokesman Michael Levine said the Focus Active is built in Europe. The company had plans to begin making the vehicle in China in the latter half of 2019 and exporting them to the US market.

But Ford said last month that it was scrapping that plan because Trump's tariffs would make the cars too expensive.

The company also reaffirmed that it has no plans to start making the car on US soil. It will continue to sell the vehicle outside the states.

Sedans and other small cars are falling out of favor with Americans.

Ford already announced earlier this year that it would reallocate $7 billion of research and development funds from cars to SUVs and trucks. Executive James Farley said at an investor's conference in January that the carmaker's lineup is ""shifting from cars to utilities.""

It's not just Ford. All three Detroit automakers have made it clear that they're going all-in on SUVs and trucks.

Ford added in its statement that it's committed to ""growing its U.S. vehicle lineup - including introducing all-new trucks, utilities, hybrids and fully electric vehicles.""

The company said about 80% of the vehicles Ford sells in the United States are built domestically.

—CNN's Chris Isidore and Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report.

First published September 9, 2018: 3:42 PM ET","Ford calculates it can make a profit if the Focus is made in China.
The Pres KNOWS those cars could be built in the U.S.A.
Ford decides not to build the car in China or USA =less profit for Ford, probably less tax income for the government.

NOTE TO iluv: I replied to your post because it was general and of interest. I think you do owe everyone an apology.","Trying to keep this on cars, can anyone explain to me in simple terms why higher tarriffs on Chinese goods is a bad thing? Other than ""it makes them more expensive for us.""

I don't follow the news, and I'm not a global economy watcher. The only opinion I have on the matter is that I have always thought the imbalance of tarriffs unfair and that we should be charging exactly what other countries charge on our goods coming into their countries.","Interesting item in the local news here about peeling paint on Toyota RAV4s:

Shades of the 1990s!","
There is no problem with imposing tariffs on particular good at particular rates, if it is thought through and applied in a way that actually might be beneficial. Slapping tarriffs on everything with no thought causes a tariff war. No one wins a tariff war. And, it is very hard on business....they plan on buying supplies etc at certain costs. Then a monkey wrench is thrown into their business model.

Take one industry for example.....the building industry in Canada. Many buildings were planned, but, the estimated building cost has risen, because of the 25% tariff on steel. Many projects are on hold.

The Ford example is a good one. You can't expect businesses to invest, when the government steps in and changes the rules so drastically suddenly. Harley Davidson is a good example. Pres says consumer can buy something else if they don't build in the USA. Someone who wants an HD is not going to want something else.

Nothing wrong with changing the rules....but, it has to be done in a thoughtful way, usually with input from experts.","
Search of internet comes up with many problems with paint.

Both owners are near the ocean. Maybe it has to do with salt in the air or something. Sometimes we get paint ruined by our steel company plants...when some pollutants escape.

Realistically though....the reply about not properly primed sounds like the answer. Hopefully Toyota will address the problem.","
While those effects may be true, one would think that they would be affecting all manufacturers to some extent in a similar way. I do not see many cars here with sheets of paint peeling away, certain decade-old Hondas excepted. The Toyota example strikes me as odd in that they built their rep by being supposedly bulletproof in quality and reliability and by standing behind their products over the long term. Their actions here sound more akin to Hyundai, Chrysler or Ford.

Also interesting in that the article references the Edmunds site in noting the paint issues, which would tend to indicate they are widespread.","
A Cincy radio car repair talk show had a call about something failing on Rav4. I tried to remember what it was but failed. The mechanic said that item has been a problem on some years and is showing up now. However, the same guy is always talking about how bulletproof the toyotas are and always bragging about how he loves them. And about how many he owns. He owns two shops that sell tires and do mechanical work.

Oh, he advertises for an area toyota store on his show--did I mention that?

All cars have problems. Sometimes people like to pretend there are none because the company has enough profits they can pay to fix things even after the original warranty period. And then people tend to think there were no transmission problems, e.g., in the car they had.

As to the paint, I recall GM paint problems on certain colors in the 80s IIRC were because PPG and others had manufacturer go to a different system. They used a primer and then a color coat over the primer followed by clear coat. The color coat let go of the primer. Earlier systems for paint had a primer followed by a bonding coat to let the color coat adhere to it. Then the clear coat. AND the color coat let go of the primer (or vice-versa). PPG was paying part of coat to recoat some vehicles. I think silver was one color that had more trouble than the others.


A search for images of toyota peeling paint gives this

Almost guaranteed not to happen, I know.","

I think imid hit it....no matter how good a car maker is, something can go wrong. Employee missed filling up paint can with primer. Or a new primer not formulated properly. Or primer ran out during the paint run. 1000s of things can go wrong when making a car...........IMHO Toyota still makes an excellent reliable car, I would be impressed if they fix the problem.","Exactly, it's not that things cannot go wrong during production, it is how the manufacturer reacts to put things right afterward. I just find it odd that a company with Toyota's reputation is shrugging their shoulders on this issue which is clearly due to a production problem.","There also is the cost factor. Some companies have had a profit advantage by being nonunion and having lots of cash to spend fixing problems that show up. That works very nicely because people tend to forget that their transmission went out of the AC compressor blew up in the middle of that trip to Phoenix last summer, when the manufacturer repairs it and even extends coverage after the warranty.

Some other companies have been strapped for cash to do those kinds of things. I frequent forums with questions about things that go wrong and I am appalled at the logic of many people who complain that the 18-year old car they bought used, e.g., has something going wrong that happens to others. AND then they complain that the manufacturer doesn't fix it free under a recall. When do people become responsible for things rather than somebody else's paying to fix it.

I just replaced the bushings on the lower control arms on my Cobalt at 130,000 miles. It tightened up the suspension control greatly and made the ride better as well as making the steering a little tighter. I never thought that GM should replace those bushings which tend to show wear on similar cars by 150,000 miles. I consider it maintenance.","Toyota became American years ago. Honda seems far more likely to step up to issues from my experiences at least.
As for Ford, they aren't going to get into brick and mortar with their current financial situation; trucks and crossovers yield much larger profit margins, so converting a line to a low quantity, low margin car seems to reflect a lack of knowledge in manufacturing strategies or just a PR stunt. btw, if you look at steel right now, expanding production capacity is now more of an automation thing than a big jobs creator unfortunately.","

If you are upside down on your car loan (or lease), then you most definitely should spend that $20 or $30 a year. But do it through your insurance company. Just my opinion, of course.

Talk about mad cow disease.

A family cow was shot and killed Wednesday morning in rural Maine after police said the animal wandered from its owner’s property and scratched a parked SUV. The cow — a young female heifer — rubbed its horns against the rear fender of a Lincoln Navigator parked on the property and damaged it. A person living in the house on the property came outside armed with a .45-caliber handgun and shot the cow, which wandered to a nearby field, where it was shot a second time. Read full article at:

That's a little extreme isn't it? Torture as a punishment for animal cruelty? It depends on the laws of the state but usually livestock is considered personal property and shooting the cow would be like scratching your neighbor's car in retaliation for him scratching yours. More a civil penalty rather than criminal. They might be able to charge him criminally for the second shot as a deliberate act of cruelty. I suppose the real animal rights activists would want the farmer charged too as a slave owner.

my TV story. In our bedroom we have a brand new 50 inch Sony TV that my wife won in a raffle so the price was perfect. 

In our family room we have a 65 inch off brand of which I currently can't remember that we bought from Eddie Bauer for $200. Yeah I said Eddie Bauer, they were closing a store near us and were selling everything including the fixtures. We managed to scoop up their big TV they used there to promote their stuff. So far that TV has been great, great picture and sound and we cant beat the price.

Those TV panels that retailers use are very heavy duty and built to take a lot of abuse. Problem with most of them, no one has bothered to guard against burn in. Some of the later plasmas had moving pixels to guard against burn in. But, they were tanks.

If you can find one that works well, it’s likely to last you decades.

Like most things electronic, the older the technology gets, the less the price. LCDs drove plasmas out of the market because of how much it cost to manufacture plasmas. LCDs won on price (like VHS over Beta).

That said, the state of LCDs today is pretty darned good. You can get a good TV, even a 55” one, for way less than $500.

That makes me cringe when I think I paid $5K for my plasma not too many years ago. But, it still chugs along and is built like a tank. Problem is, I like my LG OLED better, so my plasma isn’t getting much use these days.","Welcome back GG. I understand why the remarks hurt....but, they were nonsense, meant zero....0....nothing...nada.","Our induction cooktop is amazing. You do have to have the suitable magnetic pots and pans, but it is instaneous, not likely to burn you and quick easy clean up. The missus doesn’t want to switch it out for gas even though the gas line is right there, but a gas range looks neater.","Gas is ""best"" in terms of precision cooking, but it will always char the pots long term. I heard induction is very fast and also quite precise. People say it hums, which makes it strange a little.

I know about the cookware, already have couple of induction-ready pots. plus the rebate from GE should cover it.","
The story seems to have large holes in it. I think it was likely a loan, not a lease. As such, one has to cover difference between insurance payout and loan balance. It's easy to imagine somebody owing more than the car is worth in that case, it's probably the case for large percentage of the loans out there. In that case, the insurance pays actual cash value minus deductible and the customer has to cover the rest.

In case of leases, at least those done by mainstream banks and manufacturer finance arms, all have GAP coverage included in the payment. In that case, insurance pays ACV minus the deductible and GAP pays the rest.","

Still a little steamed, but promise this will be the last you’ll hear from me on the topic.

My late Italian parents were devout Catholics. They came straight from “the old country”, fleeing Italy’s Nazi persecution of Catholics (yes...they persecuted a lot of ethnic and religious groups).

Their journey and settlement here was not met with open arms and they were not accepted.....at first. So, it was hard. Their community, their church, kept them moving forward.

I was educated by both Franciscans and Jesuits for 12 years, as my parents felt it was important to have more than their excellent guiding hand in how I should live my life. I am a better person for the experience. So, while certainly not remotely as devout as my parents (far from it), it has had a major, positive influence in my life.

So yeah....the insult was deeply personal to me.

Anytime I hear or see the kind of language and insults hurled at something so personal as someone’s religion, regardless of whether they follow Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and all the other Faiths of the world, even if you don’t follow an organized religion, it demeans everyone. If any person preaches that sort of imbecilic rhetoric, it demeans them, too!

Didn’t mean to get so personal. I have many vices....not the least of which is my car addiction. So, regardless of my excellent Catholic education and upbringing, I still have many wide reaching faults.

For example, let's say the car owner still owed $12000 for the car, but the insurance company says the car is worth $10000 because of extra miles on it. Maybe the dealer has to take her to court to get their money. What does happen in those cases?","

The renaming in this topic to a cars and coffee and conversation label was to represent that topics wander about to suit more of what the car fans here find interesting. The examples are televisions, sound systems for home and cars, juicers, speeding tickets, court procedures, Neons, Timex, long term warranties, job changes, insurance brands, houses, water heaters, dishwashers, washers and dryers, usw.. All that along with electric vehicles and rental vehicles and companies. I've probably missed some of the topics. While I find a few not as interesting as a topic, but they are interesting because they involve people I ""know"" as posters and ""sort of friends"" here on the forum. I've asked more technical questions hoping that one of the people more expert may venture an answer about my topic.

Certainly the cars and coffee type of posts have kept this forum alive, not as alive as the car-buying bunch in Chronic Car Buyers, but good. LOL The topics are more interesting than hearing posts about the popular car brand that is nearly perfect of the month where everyone agrees that brand is the one to buy and agree there must be a few lesser models or brands to purchase. All that overlooking certain brands or models in any mentions of options in car purchasing.

I've learned that some of the most avid pursuers of great handling and power are very realistic reviewers of the more pedantic models, including, yes, even the Malibu for folks like me here in the Heartland. Other are more dogmatic in their opinions often never having driven the model in question other than a rental version that's often a grim example.

My thinking, hoping others do the same if I venture into offending someone, is that I take a breath and forgive and forget.

The Premier replaced the LT2/LTZ. All have 2.0T. I just want a car that goes and gets good mileage, not that the 2.0T doesn't get good mileage compared to peers especially based on its power output. Essentially same 2.0T as in Cadillac ATS/CTS. Too much power for my needs or wants.

Some of those TCLs have picture quality that rivals the big boys that cost 3x the price. I’m going to be redoing my home office at some point soon and will likely pick one up. 

I told part of this back in January of this year when I bought a 50 inch Samsung Ultra HD, HDR Smart TV for the office to replace the aging but still working 37 inch Toshiba LCD that I got in late 2008. I replaced the Toshiba just because I wanted a larger TV for the office.

When I went looking for a 50 inch because that was as large as I felt the office could handle, I went to Best Buy. I personally consider Samsung and LG as equals and probably the best TV's but I had heard and read good things about TCL and was willing to look at one of those but Best Buy did not have one on display. They had them but not on display. While talking to the knowledgeable sales guy he also liked Samsung and LG and thought the OLED's were terrific. I liked both of the Samsung and LG none OLED jobs and settled for the Samsung because it had a center mounted stand vs. the 2 feet supports on the LG thereby not forcing me to wall mount the LG. The Samsung would fit on the stand I already had so it won out only for that reason not because I thought it had a better picture than the LG.

The sales guy thought the TCL was a good TV but mentioned that it didn't have the track record that Samsung and LG had but he couldn't prove the quality of the picture to me because they did not have one on display. When I asked how he knew the TCL had a good picture, he said a few of the sales guys set one up in the back just to see what it looked like. When I asked him to do it again for me he said he couldn't do that because the store manager would not allow it. Since we were going to Sam's right after I stopped at Best Buy I decided to look at Sam's to see if they had a TCL on display but they didn't even sell TCL's. However, Sam's had the exact Samsung for around $50 less than Best Buy so I bought it at Sam's. I guess I should thank Best Buy for allowing me to continue shopping since they saved me some money.

I can't prove this but it sure as hell looked like Samsung, LG and the other major brands bought shelf space that TCL, at the time, was not willing to spring for at Best Buy. I have no reason to go into Best Buy again just to see if they now have a TCL on display but I gather someone must have TCL's on display by now.

Cars like that frequently end up on Craigslist.. The more honest sellers will list it as ""salvage"" if it hasn't been fixed and ""rebuilt"" if it went through some sort of repair. I know in NY such a car has to pass a specific state inspection before it can be registered. There's a national data base run by NICB where you can run a VIN check.

I hear that scammers will register such cars in non-title states like Vermont so that the branded status disappears.

I'd be very wary of a car like that unless it was dirt cheap. Especially a flood car.

Trusted dealer? Isn't that an oxymoron?

@iluvmysephia1, I hope you not serious about the religion thing.

When I was going to school when I was in the Navy back in 1960/1961 it was in Jacksonville FL. A very large Naval air station and training center. There was a used car lot, the type that has cars pulling up one after another with the screamer guy giving the cost of each. It was more than obvious that this lot was directing these commercials to the young sailors. The guy would sign-off with, ""and you can trust Christian Bob"". This was not the name of his shyster lot, just his sign-off line. I still laugh when I think back on that guy.

I've bought 5 cars off Craigslist and I never bothered with an independent inspection. Mostly it was because tbey were cheap (most expensive was $3500) but also because at that price point I expected to find $500-1000 in repairs required. I factor that into any offer.

Anything over 5k and I would get an independent inspection. Doing that doesn't guarantee perfection though. Way back in the day I bought a three yearold used Chevy from a new car dealer, had it inspected and negotiated fixes on what my mechanic found. Still, one day after the 30 day warranty expired, the AC condenser blew.","I see in that flooded vehicles picture someone wanted make sure the car flooded, so they popped the trunk.

There have been discussions here in these forums on that very topic, ""How much to discount a car for a Salvage title?"" A lot of people with a lot of different opinions, with no clear cut consensus. I think the closest thing to a real answer is, ""It depends.""

If you're looking at a 12 year old pickup truck that was totaled by the insurance company because it needed a new front bumper, grille, and hood (with no structural damage), and the clean value was $7,500, then the salvage value with the damage nicely repaired would probably be no more than 20% less.

A fairly new car, with a clean value of $25k, nicely repaired, would probably drop closer to 40%. YMMV","
Same here- the only new car's I've bought have been the two tis and the MS3. No regrets or unpleasant surprises from any used car that I've purchased.","The car would be given a thorough check by a mechanic, as suydam says. I'd ask several questions and be there during the check, too. Like I say, 51,000 miles on a 2013 Focus ST at a price of $12,500 is a really good deal. I've done my research on the car.

As far as religion goes, a lot of false preachers **cough**cough** like Catholics **cough**cough** have not followed the word of God, yet they claim to be authorities on the word of God. There will be double the punishment for them. Know that is true. I trust in my faith and I trust in the living God. I know that what I believe, he also believes. Enough so that I trust this guy selling the Focus ST. Besides, I would get the car checked out first. And his used car dealership has a great reputation in town. He's been in the business 26 years.

Having said all that, the car could have a failure of an expensive part at any time after I buy it. Just a part of the car business.","

When I was on a dealer trade ride at another dealership, I was waiting in the showroom for the new car manager to give me the keys, manuals, etc., of a car I was picking up for a customer. I overheard a customer who was screaming at the top of his lungs at the used car manager because of a ""lemon"" he bought that morning from one of the used car salesmen. It was a 5 year old Lexus RX300 (I believe this took place in 2005 IIRC). He said that when he got his car home and parked it in his driveway, the radiator exploded under the hood and poured all over his concrete drive. When he lifted the hood, he also noticed brake fluid all over the inside left wheel well. The dealer refused to pick up the RX300 so the guy had to have it towed to the dealership. The used car manager kept reminding the customer that he bought the car ""AS IS"". They were refusing the do anything for the poor guy who had just spent $17,500 on the used Lexus.

I did not hang around long enough to find out the end result - but I used the above as an example of what dealers are capable of doing. There are lots of unscrupulous dealerships out there - probably not as many today as there were years ago, but still there are crooks, cheats, slight-of-hand salesmen, etc., who are as bad if not worse than private party sales.","abacomike

A few comments Mike;
I think your chances are better of getting a good used car if it is bought from a new car dealer. New car dealers want to stay in business, want to have a good reputation, want to sell you a new car one day....and they have a lot invested and want to maintain their reputation.

*No car is 100% guaranteed from having problems. But a certified car has been gone over and checked, if the dealer is good questionable cars will go to auction or to an indie dealer. Seems dealers work with independents, makes dealing with an indie a bit more dicey since they are farther down the food chain.

Agree with all of the above. I’ve had really good experiences buying used cars from a dealers lot. I still get them checked out, though! I remember buying a very used Mazda 626 hatch MT for my college son, and finding out upon inspection that the CV boots were leaking and needed replacing. The dealer did so and honored the price we had agreed on. Glad I had that checked out first though, because it ways definitely an AS IS car.

See all those cars in that flooded area?  That’s what happened here over the weekend to low-lying areas in Southwest Miami-Dade County.  We had 12” of rain in parts of south Florida.","If the water gets in, cars become salvage. You can, sometimes, dry them out and restore them but once electronics get wet will never be the same.","The used car operators try to disguise the damage from the flood water. Finding it sometimes requires an expert. They check things such as the edges of seat tracks and seat metals where rust may show and look for water lines and dust residue from mud in water that show up under the dash and in other places the used car sales folks can't hide or clean easily.

These cars are often moved into other areas. After the floods in Florida, Texas, and other areas, we get warnings here in flyover country from car folks about watching out for cars that have been moved here, where we don't expect to find flood damage.

The electronics will never been the same. After a period of time poor connections and other problems start to show up. I recall someone who had their car flooded at the Grand Ole Opry hotel in Nashville years ago. They were able to drive it home--I don't recall if it was immediately or after a period of time when they went back for it.

Here in Texas, if the insurance pays off on a flood damaged vehicle, it will (usually) be retitled with a “Salvage Title”. The title will not tell you why the vehicle was totaled by an insurance company, Carfax will often (but not always) show the reason.

There are people here in Houston who purchase cars at auction with relatively minor body damage, do the body work, and resell the cars not hiding the “salvage title”. They will usually have pictures showing the body damage before it was repaired, allowing you to judge for yourself how severe the damage was.

I have twice bought cars (one car, one truck, actually) that had salvage titles, but I saw proof of why they were “totaled” by the insurance company, so I knew exactly what I was getting into.

If there were no insurance on one of those cars in your picture, then it would not be “totaled”, and the title would not change to “salvage”. Those are the ones you have to worry about. One trick I was told about: pull off the inside door panel, and look for water marks inside the door.

I haven't gone to a movie in 20 years and don't expect that to change. What's interesting to me is to watch the promos from movies that cost big bucks to produce and disappeared without a trace, when I go into my DVR and watch a TV show that originally aired 2 or 3 years ago and see ads that aired when they premiered. The studios obviously spent many 10s of millions on these turkeys and the ads for them promised all sorts of thrills but the movie was an utter failure. Hard to determine why because it seems a majority of them all rely on the same formula of CGI special effects and cartoon-like characters instead of well-written scripts. Yet some make money and some flop. To me that is the biggest change in the movie business, the decline of writing and character-driven plots in exchange for increasingly complex special effects and visual stimulation. It has zero appeal to me.","That's exactly why the Mrs., our son and I are all so hooked on the series 'Longmire'.

Because the car was being sold by a private party first. He parked it on that open lot. They couldn't sell it, so it was either bought by a used car dealer in town or it's going to be a consignment sale of some sort. I don't know why the discrepancy with mileage - it's all of a sudden got 10,000 miles less and listed for $1,000 more. That part is understandable, the Focus ST should be listed at $16,000, not $12,500.

We were looking for something to replace a sofa and love seat that we have in the family room that should have been replaced during the Johnson administration (Andrew Johnson).

It was hard, getting all comfortable on a sofa then my wife telling me to get up and look at another one. Getting up a few seconds after getting comfortable over and over is hard to do, especially when you're getting older and joints just don't work to well.

But we found a L shaped sectional with an oversized ottoman that we liked and was comfortable. Got some prices on it in different configurations and with and without the ottoman. Prices was out the door including delivery and a 5 year warranty for damage and stains. 

My wife said she didnt want the stain warranty and we could pick it up ourselves (meaning I would have to load in and carry it into the house with someone I conned into helping me). We did like the sofa and were discussing it when the saleslady asked us what she could do to get us to buy. I told her if they threw in the warranty and delivery at no charge we had a deal. We had a deal. 

They also had 18 months interest free financing which we took ( free money), and we will have it paid in 17 months. The only issue is that it's a brand new item not in stock yet so it will be 4 or 5 weeks before we get it.

Now last night at home my wife reviews the sales paperwork and starts complaining that they charged us for the warranty and the delivery. I said I know but they discounted the furniture price by the same amount to cover it so it effectively comes to free delivery and warranty. 

Now as we are about to leave my wife spies an interesting looking lamp in the clearance section that didn't have a match for it for the price of $20. So we bought it cash, the receipt stated a price of $220 with a $200 discount.

I just looked at basic financials of Ford: 1. Assets: $258B, Liabilities: $226B. It's positive, but if you consider that book value of an asset is not the same as a market value of one that has to be sold in distress (if that comes), this can be quickly flipped. 2. They have $115B in current assets (easy to liquidate at par value), vs. $152B in current debt, including long term debt that comes due, plus $22B accounts payable. This is not that pretty. Of course, they have huge cashflows, to cover a lot of those current payments, but they'll have to roll over a lot of debt soon. 3. They almost doubled their dividend this year - not very responsible move in light of peak auto, huge debt expenses. BTW, I was wrong about the source of that 6%+ dividend. It came not only from stock going down, it did come from the management raising it. Income and cash flow statements do not look that great either: 1. Dividend is $1B+ per quarter ($4/year going out) 2. Quarterly cash flow dropped $1B y/y (15%), so did net income, also by $1B (but this is 50%). They made half of the profit with revenue lower by $1B than last year. BTW, they paid 40% less income tax in the same period. So: similar (but lower) revenue, lower taxes, half the net profit. Ouch. 3. They spend $17.5B last 12 months on capital expenditures, which is about 2.5 times their typical annual rate in last five years. 4. So, funny, that billion lost in revenue vs. last year is exactly billion lost in profit. So what happens if they lose another billion in revenue? Then the profit is zero. Another billion? You get the picture. This goes on. No wonder credit agencies are not impressed. Again - this doesn't mean Ford is going under. It just means, it has much less room for an error and much more sensitivity to external issues and credit rating agencies had to weigh it all. It means Ford will pay more for its new debt and those who want out of its current bonds will have to take less. Does it mean the stock is a sell? Not necessarily, but beware for sure. Even if one believes it will be fine (and it may just be), one would be well advised not to put too much of their wealth into it right now.
One thing you have to realize that net profits don't tell the whole story. Financial statements can be influenced by write offs, one time payouts and a multitude of other things that you would have to look through the note to those financial statements. ","oldfarmer50 said:

I think if they can't make money with sedans they should form an association with someone who can. They did it with Mazda, Chrysler did it with Mitsubishi and GM did it with Suzuki et al. Right now they are using Ford Australia to bring back the Ranger pick up, why not someone else to produce sedans?
I don't think it's an issue of not being able to turn a profit with sedans as much as they are looking at concentrating on the part of their business that is far more profitable. 

Sedan sales are in a decline and truck, SUV and crossover sales are a large segment in US vehicle sales.

Of course, but footnotes are usually used to make the table to look better, not worse. If the main numbers are showing Ford spending billions, losing revenue, having high current debt positions (need to refinance soon), I can only imagine what footnotes would reveal. My point is Ford is visibly stressed and the stress seems to be raising due to the peak auto. At the same time Ford is spending large sums of money, presumably to improve its product and process, but this only increases overall risk, as cashlows seem to deteriorate due to makroeconomic concerns (peak auto). Therefore, the credit agency's downgrade with negative outlook does not seem to be unreasonable, even if it all turns to be ""nothing"" after all (which it may).","

Ford is far from going under, but lowered credit rating simply reflects an opinion about the risk of not paying its all obligations in the future, including very distant one. It's usually based on stress scenarios, from global economic downturn, to country-specific issues and how it can affect overall company's ability to pay its current debt. Ford's profitability is currently under pressure, its models are old and tired (in comparison to say GM), its strategy appears a bit erratic (plans to ditch passenger cars from the US lineup have a smell of desperation, IMHO) and it did not ""enjoy"" a hard reset, GM had during bankruptcy. All these things are fixable, but require money, which Ford will have to borrow. However, we are on the other side of peak auto (which btw was delayed by one year due to Harvey/Irma), making payoff for those lineup investments even riskier. It already has high fixed costs, if the sales drop even more (say we go into more serious auto downturn due to saturation, or recession) and Ford is in the middle of big spending spree, the situation can get much more dicey for them. Rating agencies have to weigh those kind of risk scenarios and run stress-tests on finances of the companies before the actual stress happens.

To say, it will always work for them, because it did before, is ignoring the history. Graveyards are full of companies that did not survive the downturn, whether because of the cycle, or competition. How many car brands worldwide disappeared in last 30 years? How many of them changed owners, sold at the bottom, rather than top? Just recently, Opel was a German brand owned by an American company, since before World War II, I believe. Today it's a French owned company and who knows if they even keep it around. They have Peugeots, Citroens to sell and Opel/Vauxhall are in the same brand segments. The only reason to keep those would be to sell it to Germans, Brits (perhaps Australians, if French actually bought that, too), and certain Eastern Europeans, who won't buy French car. But I can see Opel/Vauxhall pulling from other markets, especially emerging markets in Africa and Asia, where Peugeot and Citroen have stronger presence and traditions from colonial times.","
That dividend will be first thing to go (partially or fully), if finances deteriorate. All it takes is total US market losing sales of say million cars per year for couple of years and it can go very, very wrong.

It's probably about the price point that those vehicles could command in Europe. Opel was a real laggard vs. its peers in term of sales and appeal.

Even if not fully support, I can understand the sentiment. However, this can quickly escalate into something nobody remembers how it all started and nobody knows how to end.

Another thing, politicians, labor unions and managements of involved companies are often very disingenuous (to be charitable), when they cry foul over how foreign countries and their protections (that's not unique to America, of course, it's everywhere). Vehicles are actually a great example: everybody and their brother now knows how how unfair and evil European tariffs are on US passenger cars, but just mention to them ""chicken tax"" and see what they say... It is 25% duty on light trucks in force since 1964, which was imposed by the way in response on France's and Germany's tariffs on chickens (hence the name). Did you really think Big Three were this much better in SUVs and pickups than everybody else in the world, that was why nobody seriously challenged them for so long and everybody else making them uses facilities in the US (as opposed to cars, which often are imported)?
We can go industry, by industry - suddenly all that ""unfair"" foreign competition ""killing"" those oh-so-poor companies isn't so unfair after all. The old parable about seeing a grass in somebody's eye and ignoring the log in your own comes in mind.... For every bad tariff in EU we have our Chicken Tax, agricultural subsidy, or some other prohibition for foreign capital to start or purchase certain type of business in the US. It would be nice to make it all go away and let real advantages to play out, but it's not realistic to do it right away. We shouldn't believe (or at least be skeptical about) political/corporate talking points, or worse, completely uninformed spews from the Ignoramous. The truth is usually much more complicated by several orders of magnitude than 140 characters can ever express, even if they are dished out in series of twenties over the weekend. We should at least acknowledge that simple truth.

My Japan built Denon receiver is a paper weight right now because of poor customer service by Denon, and poor warranty support. It was over 3.5 years old when it started failing, so well past the 3 year warranty, but not that much past it. I got the feeling that the authorized service centers lacked confidence they had support for replacement parts in stock. I'd understand if it was 10 or more years old. I may have gotten a leftover, but still that puts it at no more than 6 years since release. The frustrating part is I know the amp section works, and the analog section works, it's obviously a problem with the digitial side of the receiver, it just can't play digital sources (but AM/FM, Analog RCA connected CD player works), HDMI/Optical doesn't.

Anyway, I never sold my slightly older HK 7550HD beast of a receiver. It's close to 50 pounds, and let me tell you, as good as the Denon was, it was a lightweight in the low 30 pounds area, and it shows when you listen to the Harmon Kardon's greatness. I'm very happy with the HK, and will use it until it has an issue.

Surprisingly, for some reason despite being a top notch high end receiver, it doesn't have a phono input for record players. The Denon had one, must be because of the more recent resurgence of vinyl. Turns out to be a blessing in disguise. I bought a little PROJECT phono preamp box for about $70 bucks, and it makes the built-in one on the Denon sound like absolute trash. Why include a built-in phono preamp if it's going to be garbage? Better to not include one, because the preamp really does make my records sound much better. A bad preamp in a $200 receiver makes sense, but in a $2,000+ (retail) receiver? I feel cheated by Denon. This $70 part shouldn't have made such a difference!

Regarding Sirius, I drew my line in the sand, and they chose to remain on the other side of it. Wasted 30 minutes of my life on the phone again with them, but this will be the last. I ended up cancelling service for the 2 cars that still had it.

They said the promotion I wanted (60 bucks for 1-year) was not available until tomorrow. I know Sirius' tactics, and I told them I wasn't calling back again tomorrow to waste more time, so do it now or lose me as a cutomer. They put me on hold for like 5 minutes, but came back to say they would not budge, I'm no longer a Sirius Customer, and I'm mad they wasted 30 minutes when I gave them the bottom line right at the start of the conversation on what it would take to keep me as a customer. Even worse, instead of saying the supervisor decided to say no to me, they mentioned another offer they were doing that was still on the other side of my line on the sand. As if I can't do the math and figure out they are making a worse offer than the previous one.

As far as I'm concerned, Sirius is a stain on humanity. I""m relieved to be done with them. I reluctantly stayed with them when bribed at $5/month, but I kept forgetting to renew on-time at 6 months, so the 1 year deal was a necessity as they gouge you upon renewal.

However, if they dare to call me tomorrow offering the deal they wouldn't do today, the offer was only good yesterday. Tomorrow my line in the sand is $55/year per car.","berri said:

It’s one of the reasons I don’t understand how the stock market works.  Ford is making money hand over fist on F-150s.

Then you have Tesla who has yet to turn a profit, has production problems, supplier problems, and is also (for now) getting their sales subsidized by the federal government and some states as well.","

Ford Motor Company has survived since the Model T.  They even built bombers during WWII and even tanks.  I truly believe that Ford is versatile and agile as far as corporations go.  Yes, their stock is almost at junk status but Ford has something(s) up its sleeve.  No way is the family going to allow this great American company to go the way of others whose names have all but disappeared.

At $10 a share, I am sure the family is buying back shares in order to gain more of a foothold on where and how the company continues being a great manufacturing conglomerate.  If I was 15 years younger, I would be buying Ford stock at $10 a share - at least 10,000 shares.  Unfortunately, I am almost 74 years old and must maintain a conservative approach to money.  I am currently getting 2.5% on CD’s and Money Markets.  But at least it’s insured and safe.  I expect a return of 3% by the end of the year.  That’s a far cry from .08% which I got 1.5 years ago.

Yep, I would be buying Ford stock now if I was younger and still working.",Trying to imagine Eva Gabor driving a PT Cruiser. Not working.,"aba - learned long ago that while the auto and airline industries are fascinating to follow, their stock is best left to frequent traders rather than long term investors. Personally, after reading quite a few business articles on this, I can't help wondering whether a big part of the Ford problem is articulating clearly where they are going. GM and FCA have done this better. But Ford may have two big issues they need to get a handle on; stale product line up and faltering international business. Other than niche players, the auto industry is global. As for their stock, I understand the bargain potential at under $10, but I'd like to see it over that threshold because many investment firms don't buy stocks priced that low and cumulatively, investment firms tend to make or break markets for a stock. Also, investors tend to look down the road rather than today, and despite the strong F-150, they don't see the rest of the company competitive in a few years without some significant changes and improvements.","I never saw anything on ""the real story"" of why Ford fired Mark Fields and replaced him with Jim Hackett, who so far has shown no indication he is in any way qualified to be their CEO. Would be interesting to try to understand that move better.

I have a Thorens turntable, still. It’s not the one I originally had, but one I picked up used. I’ve rebuilt it and use it.

A vinyl setup isn’t for casual listening. Each album is 15-20 minutes per side. So, unless you are sitting in your chair, planning on flipping or digging through your vinyl collection for a longer term listening event, vinyl isn’t the format you want.

That said, there’s a certain satisfaction in digging through an album collection, finding long lost gems, cleaning the record, putting it on the turntable, lowering the tone arm/stylus and listening for several minutes. Did it all the time in college.

You may make a nice profit down the road, but holding it too long will often underperform over the years. More than a few bought classic conservative retire with stocks in the past when they were down and paying a nice dividend. Eventually they got burned. Think GE, Sears, even the grocer A&P years back. I've been looking at possibly buying a Ford Edge. Some good deals and it seems like a nice vehicle. I like it. My caution though isn't Ford going BK, it is the deal versus the depreciation. When you net it out, something like a Highlander ends up a better choice.","@abacomike - sorry, I disagree about Ford. There is no ""divine right of corporations"".

Even IBM, my former employer, has had a brush with death in the early 1990's. And, they are struggling now with this whole ""cloud"" approach and AI.

Not going well, and IBM is laying off thousands of people in the process, even from companies that they recently purchased and were considered part of their new ""core"" businesses.

If Ford can't adapt to a changing market, or if they bet too big on strategies that don't pan out, I could see someone swooping in and buying the valuable assets (F-150) and discarding the rest.","You can add Sears, Toys R' Us, Circuit City, etc. to that list too. A few years ago wasn't Best Buy also closing stores and going down the wrong path only to reinvent themselves, stabilize, and become a mainstay again?

In regards to burial or cremation that’s a tough call.

When my father died two years ago I know that the family gathering together with people who knew him, and going through the familiar rituals of burial and shiva, was very comforting. The kids still talk about how meaningful that moment was. In regards to burial or cremation that’s a tough call. For me, coming from a tradition that prescribes burial, and knowing one of the great horrors of the Holocaust was violating that principle and turning people into smoke, I just can’t do that. OTOH I know many people have made that choice and I respect it.

I said if he could manage to visit various racetracks and scatter some each time, that would probably be ideal.","

I walked in the main entrance and immediately got nauseated by the heavily “perfumed” odor of the entire place.  Luckily I was met by a funeral director who saw I was struggling with the “aroma” and immediately led me to his office where he closed the door and handed me a packet of smelling salts.  After a few minutes I was able to recover mainly because his office didn’t smell of perfume and the fact that the smelling salts enabled me to get my wits about me.  This is not a great place to visit if you are alive and “breathing”!

I explained that I wanted to prepay my final arrangements so my children wouldn’t have to.  I explained that there was an empty grave next to my mom and it was free and clear.  I also explained that I didn’t want a fancy or expensive memorial service or funeral.  So he showed me “economical” final arrangement options which, for the most part, amounted to over $8000 for everything including the hearse, a cheap pine casket stained to look like oak, the visitation, the 50+ mile trip to the gravesite and police escort.  There was even a charge for digging the grave.

I asked if there was a “less expensive way to leave behind my loved ones” and he said he could eliminate floral arrangements as well as the evening before memorial service.  I said fine.  He said that brought the cost down to $7300.  

I finally asked if it would be less expensive to have me cremated and my ashes put in a cardboard box and placed a couple of feet below the surface of my grave with no funeral, no hearse, no memorial service, etc.  He said the cemetary requires the standard opening of the grave, casket or ashes - as well as a foot stone marker - so it didn’t matter.  The cost would be $2900, but he urged that I get an urn for my children’s sake and eliminate burying the ashes at the cemetery.  I could immediately envision them both fighting over who would be lucky enough “to not have to” accept my remains.

I told the funeral director thanks and that I wanted to think this over.

He gave me another packet of smelling salts in order to get to my car without heaving or passing out and I walked to the front entrance holding my breath all the way.

Did you literally mean ""mp4"" or did you mistype ""mp3""? The *.mp4 file extension is generally used for videos, and the embedded audio in an mp4 is usually aac. If you're ripping your cd's to play them back on your phone or in your car, then you usually have a choice of mp3 or aac. The aac encoder is newer and more efficient, it is what Apple uses. And the file extension used if you choose aac encoding will be ""*.m4a"".

On the CD versus USB playback, there should be no real difference as long as we're talking the same mp3 file, just stored on a different medium. If we're talking an original store bought audio cd, then yes, that is a higher quality source, and you may hear the difference. Double blind listening tests don't usually bear that out, but ...

Now there are some audio purists (the same ones who claim vinyl sounds better than digital) who will talk about ""jitter"" and such when you are playing back music from an optical disk (CD).

I have to ask, is the CD player single disk or multiple disks. If single disk I would agree being in the glove compartment does discourage use but not so much for multi disk players. The sebring has a six disk CD player and when I used to use it (now just play off the phone) I would only change disks only a few times a month.

They are single disk players. My last car to have a 6-CD changer was the Accord, 2003 model right on the center dash. I'd agree that a 6-disc changer would make the glove box a more appropriate location. I don't want a changer though, a single disc player is good enough, but it takes so little room, they should just make a skinny slot in the dash. On the bright side, the sound quality of the disc player is excellent. Really shows how Sirius is limited in bandwidth and bit rate.

Not by me, but one day I foresee a driver suing VW/Audi for a collision caused by trying to get a CD in the slot of the glove compartment while driving. Exhibit 1 for the defense will probably be a caution/danger box in the owner's manual saying to not do exactly that.","
He said the ONLY reason to replace the head gaskets is if there is anti-freeze in the oil when you check it.

However, what I don't get is equipping a vehicle with an expensive, often optional or upgraded sound system and not being able to really utilize its fidelity without a cd player or at least HD radio (if your area gets that). Satellite probably gives better fidelity than mp music, but is subject to interference or cutting out at times in my experience, and plays a lot of repetition if you listen to it a lot everyday.

No, it most definitely does not rule that out. Kinda makes me wonder, too. Cooling system problems (clogged up radiator for instance) would tend to show up during extended idling.

I have seen or read a number of complaints, people claiming that satellite radio was compressed more and sounded worse than MP3 music. To my ears, it sounds fine. The Wikipedia page for XM satellite radio states they store their music library in aac format at 384 kbit/s, which is indeed very high quality. However, they apparently dynamically allocate bandwidth on the fly so the signal you actually get will be less.

To the technically uninitiated, aac is newer and better than mp3, giving better results in a smaller size / lower bitrate.","Q, you got enough parts already off the top end, might as well pop the heads and see what is going on.

I don’t know about planned obsolescence, but if you look at the trajectory, ‘50s through the ‘70s saw analog vinyl rise. Late ‘70s through the ‘80s it was the cassette tape. Mid-‘80s CDs happened along through the ‘00s. From the time the iPod/iPhone was released (2010 or thereabouts), music on a small device became a reality in conjunction with peer-to-peer file sharing (music files, mainly).

Currently, the streaming services are in their heyday. But, once again, vinyl has made a comeback presumably because it sounds better (no real proof of that).

So, each format had about a decade of popularity, some had more longevity and popularity than others.

I’m sure if you had told the music industry that planning the obsolescence of the CD (which, in part, led to peer-to-peer music sharing like NAPSTER), they never would have planned it.

-Timing should be set to 35 degrees Top Dead Center
-Distributor should be pointing to the #1 Cylinder (it could fit on properly, but be off 180 degrees)
-A tooth on your distributor could be off
-Make sure the firing order is correct in the distributor cap
-Make sure the timing chain is lined up properly
-Aluminum radiators require special ""Aluminum Compatible Coolant.""
-Your distributor gear could be in wrong
-Thermostat could be bad, old, or incorrect
-The Heads/Valve Springs/Cam all have to match up (High lift cams require different valve springs)
-The Damper needs to be lined up
-The line on the harmonic balancer needs to match up with the timing chain
-Have you replaced the head gaskets? They need to be installed correctly (left & right). If they are installed upside down, they will fit, but maybe block a port.

I bemoan the exit of the CD slot. In Acuras (as well as some others), they served as a playback device in my car for hi Rez audio. I have a bunch of really good, multi-channel disks on DVD-Audio and DTS. Now, in the current Acura, the slot only plays regular CDs and DTS disks. So, I keep my DVD-Audio listening for home. I don’t know about planned obsolescence, but if you look at the trajectory, ‘50s through the ‘70s saw analog vinyl rise. Late ‘70s through the ‘80s it was the cassette tape. Mid-‘80s CDs happened along through the ‘00s. From the time the iPod/iPhone was released (2010 or thereabouts), music on a small device became a reality in conjunction with peer-to-peer file sharing (music files, mainly). Currently, the streaming services are in their heyday. But, once again, vinyl has made a comeback presumably because it sounds better (no real proof of that). So, each format had about a decade of popularity, some had more longevity and popularity than others. I’m sure if you had told the music industry that planning the obsolescence of the CD (which, in part, led to peer-to-peer music sharing like NAPSTER), they never would have planned it. That leads me to believe it was just technology marching on that caused all of these new formats.
I don't think it's planned obsolescence but rather progress marching forward. As technology advances old tech becomes obsolete and the technology that replaces it will also become obsolete as technology progresses.

As for vinyl sounding better some actually did. It really depended on the quality of the production and how new the record was. DMM (Direct Metal Mastering) records had absolutely excellent sound quality that matches anything today. The main issue with vinyl is that everytime you played a record the needle would cause wear on the grooves that would eventually reduce the sound quality. Back in the 80's and 90's when I got a LP the very first time I played it I recorded it on cassette and used the cassette to listen to music only playing the LP to record it when the cassette went bad.","
Didn't the light touch cartridges using elliptical needles with diamond tip really reduce the wear on the slopes of the groove?",Tidying up the phone and almost forgot I took this when I was out at the Edmunds offices in Santa Monica. I kind of like the matte finish in white or silver. I'm not so sure about lime green matte,"The music industry fought the changes that emerged with the internet and digital distribution tooth and nail. Remember digital audio tape recording (DAT)? Back in the 90s it was seen by the industry as The Great Satan because it could make perfect copies forever, etc., and they got the US Congress to pass a tax on DAT media. Then Napster came along and they fought that. They seemed totally incapable of adapting to the new tech for a long time. Add to that the decline of radio importance in popularizing music and artists, the decline in album purchasing which severely cut into the profitability of labels, and the music industry is a shell of what it once was. That was the result of their lack of any planned strategy to deal with the changes, hardly planned obsolescence.","Another thing that I think said a lot about the industry was, at least in my day back in the 90s, you'd often get one or two good songs per album. Now you can just pick songs rather than buying the whole album.","Both of my latest automotive loves, the 2017 and/on Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed and the 2013 and/on Ford Focus ST 6-speed, actually have CD players. I'd rather have them than not, though I play music off my flashdrive about 90% of the time these days. I can hold 54 albums on the one I bought and I've got about 20 albums on there now. I've still got 10-15 CD's stored in cubbyhole's in the 2011 Kia Soul but have been considering removing them soon. I could use those spots to put other things, eh?","imidazol97 said:

it might of but I don't think it was much of a reduction. No matter what you needed a certain amount of friction to cause the needle to vibrate properly to get good sound quality.","fintail said:

While an album might contain only one or two popular songs that made it onto the radio. But they often had some hidden gems that you would like but never seemed to make it to the radio.","
One area where I know that the numbers were distorted was in DUI accidents. If a passenger was intoxicated then an accident was classified as: ""alcohol involved.""","I can’t remember whether I have told this story here before, so here goes.

Back around 1977 one of my coworkers gave me a 1970 Dodge Challenger convertible. It had been sitting in his garage for 2 years, the story was he paid a shade tree mechanic to rebuild the engine and it was “never right afterwards”. He was getting married, his new wife wanted to park in the garage, the non-running convertible had to go.

The paint was in bad condition, the carpet was shot, but the top still seemed okay and the tires were at least holding air. I borrowed a trailer, loaded it up, and hauled it up to the small town in East Texas where I was born and raised, about 75 miles north of Houston. My father had his own independent service garage, and allowed me to use his facilities. It took very little to get the car started and running, the old 318 V8, very reliable. But it had a strange overheating problem. Very strange indeed. I fooled around, trying to figure it out, and the passenger side head cracked. Really unusual, my father with more than 30 years experience had never seen anything like it.

I pulled the engine out and started tearing it down for a complete rebuild. Lo and behold, when I removed the water pump I found a freeze plug in the circulation hole or port on the passenger side behind the water pump. The side where the head had cracked. Obviously, the shade tree mechanic had inserted a freeze plug where it did not belong.

I’ll bet even the “car doc” would have had a very hard time diagnosing that one without tearing down the engine.","I had a pretty nice analog set up with one of my first “real” jobs that paid “real” money after I graduated in the ‘80s. I think I probably had $4,000-$5,000 in that rig, which today is....what?.....$10K? Maybe $12K in todays money.

I had a nice Carver amp driving some Magnepan speakers with a Thorens turntable. My whole living room was considered the “stereo room”. I think I bought the first CD player in the little town I was living in at the time. Cost easily $1,200, but after I heard a demo, it was a no brainer. No pops, clicks, hiss and a signal to noise ratio better than anything I had ever heard before. I still remember the first disks I heard were.....Paul Simon’s “Graceland” and ‘Till Tuesdays “Welcome Home”. I was stunned.

I spent the next 10 years replacing my vinyl with CDs. Some of the remasteres were good....some not so much, and the vinyl was better, even with the hiss, pops, cracks and poor signal to noise.

A colleague at the time, had even more money invested in his vinyl system....two Conrad Johnson monoblocks, QUAD ESL speakers, a Linn turntable with a cartridge that cost $1,000 alone (remember these were ‘80s dollars). He spent more on cables than I did on my wardrobe. It indeed sounded spectacular.

He came over to listen to the new CD player I had. He bought the exact same one I had the very next day and began selling off his analog system over the next year.

Ah...the memories of being young and frivolous. Priorities changed real quick after that....wife....kid.....no more stereo expenditures.","
A fair number of accidents are related to driver competency level and that's almost impossible to blend into the statistics. For one person, a speed of 85 mph is a big nothing; for another person, it's potentially lethal.","
I had a Thorens table I bought off of ebay probably 15 years ago. Slowly rebuilt it over time and it sounded great. Sold it recently; the values have gone up.","@graphicguy, wow, I haven't thought about Magneplanar speakers in a long time. I almost bought a pair of these in the early 80's. Bought some Klipschorn speakers instead and man were those some monsters. The Magnaplanars sounded good, but I couldn't get past the different technology. My loss. Also loved my Nakamichi cassette deck.","
Nah, he would have solved the problem by just looking at it...",85mph out on the open road ain't nothing but on I-5 near Seattle it is. People pulling out of the left lane into the middle lane in front of a speeder is one accident waiting to happen.,"
I'm still using a 1990 vintage Rotel RCD-855 in my system; I love it.","I don't think 85 is possible near Seattle unless one is out late at night. Get away from the city, and left lane campers become like pylons.
","So then if you are lucky, 3-4 good songs, and maybe 8 mediocre forgettable songs. Now, I can just buy the ones I want.

I explained this before but for some of the other slow ones in here like you, I'll do it again.

When Edmunds did their not so seamless system change, I decided to just sit on the couch in the family room and use my dumb phone to sign up to the new Insider thingy and not go upstairs to do it on my PC in the office. For a while I thought I paid for that laziness but not really.

Let me back up for just a minute. Even before the Insider thingy, Edmunds had an incorrect email for me that I tried to change at least a dozen times over the years with no success. Finally I just gave up and when something glitched either with my hardware or Edmunds old system and I got the ""Howdy Stranger"" pop up page, I just had to remember the incorrect email address and enter it along with my user name. It always worked and I got in here so I just kept doing it like that whenever something glitched.

Then came the glorious change over so I figured once and for all I'll use my correct email but of course I'd use my same user name (@jmonroe). Sounded very logical to me but now Edmunds gave me a pop up box saying someone already had that user name (and I knew who that was) so rather than fight it I chose @jmonroe1.

Now for some confusion. When I went to the office later that day and logged in here, I see that Edmunds still recognized @jmonroe (the one and only original). Knowing now what happened when I did the switchover with my phone, I just let it alone using the old adage, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"".

I know that sooner or later my PC or Edmunds will glitch and probably won't recognize the @jmonroe guy anymore so I'll have to go with @jmonroe1 on my PC also when that happens. But until that happens you'll see me both ways.

Also, even before the change over, Edmunds changed my mug shot and then changed it back again. If you guys remember, the original @jmonroe mug shot was a smiley green faced guy but now I'm a smiley red faced thing. The mug shot assigned to @jmonroe1 is a blank staring red faced guy with glasses. FWIW, neither of these mug shots look like Dean Martin. BTW, I see your mug shot has also changed. So much for seamless.

So there you have it. At least for now, when you see @jmonroe you'll know I'm posting from my PC and when you see @jmonroe1 you'll know I'm posting from my phone.

Don't blame me for this.

The car industry needs room for bigger LED screens, but honestly, how much of a that stuff do you actually use very frequently?

You can adjust when it flashes. So rather than guessing how far before TDC the mark is when it flashes, you can adjust the pulse until the mark is back to zero and the digital readout tells you how many degrees before or after TDC it is. What is silly about the Dodge is that the timing marks only go to 10 degrees BTDC, yet you need around 30 ""all in"" around 2500 rpm. No way to measure that with a standard light other than guesstimating or going ghetto and putting the timing tape on the damper.

Not to get into it with you on this (this will be my only post regarding it) but just because you disagree with them doesn't mean they are lying. There is ample proof that speed is a contributing factor in many accidents and does increase the severity of an accident. And there is ample proof that driving faster is inherently more dangerous.

There I said my peace and will say no more.","Speaking of SiriusXM, I just got my Amex bill and found a charge for $122.25 to SiriusXM, made on 7/26/2018. I obviously failed to get ahead of that one, my mistake. They used to notify me in advance before they auto-renewed, but that seems to be no longer true.

So I called them on the phone and gave them some h-e-double-l for not notifying me in advance, asked to cancel, got switched to customer retention, and wound up paying $42.05 for the next 6 months. But I am on the hook $21 for this last month’s service, no way out of that, water under the bridge.

Next, I called Amex and asked them why I wasn’t notified of the charge. I have my account set to notify me of all charges where the credit card is not present, and normally Amex is quite good about that. The answer is they don’t notify you of a recurring payment, the company doing the recurring payment is supposed to notify you. Which of course, SiriusXM did not do, being the sneaky underhanded business that they are. So I have this in my calendar now for Feb 25, 2019 (2 days before the next renewal.

I hate SiriusXM. Or, more correctly, I hate their business practices, but like their product. And of course they have no real competition, unless you want to subscribe to a streaming service on your phone (which I don’t really want to do). Not nearly as convenient as the built in SiriusXM in new cars.

Hmmm… If I were to go over to a streaming service (spotify, or whatever) – do they have “channels” like SiriusXM? With Android AutoPlay, do you get the same information on your dash as you do with SiriusXM (song title, artist, etc)?","Pandora has channels, yes. Not quite the same but close enough.

My kids new Jetta doesn’t have XM so she is getting used to streaming Spotify (she had premium) and probably Pandora. She can make playlists from Spotify on her phone so doesn’t have to data stream in the car.

One thing I will give them credit for though. During the time I had it I found I only listened to a few channels regularly, Classic Rewind, 80s on 8 and a couple of others. I also found their playlists were not particularly deep, so you would hear many of the same songs with some frequency if you stayed with it long enough. I learned from those things that I liked certain songs or artists I had forgotten about, and was sick of some others. I used that knowledge when I was building my music library and playlists to put on a USB stick that now has taken their place in my car.

You learn something every day: To determine how many clowns can fit in the car, it’s simple math. It’s a volume calculation. An American Standard Clown (ASC) is 5’ 8” tall and weighs 158 pounds. Each clown takes up approximately 3 cubic feet of space. A completely bare clown car probably has about 120 cubic feet of total space for clowns. So about 40 clowns should be able to fit in a clown car. But there are other factors, such as clowns need to breath, the need to exit the car quickly, and the use of props. Therefore, a typical clown car fits between 14 and 21 clowns with their props. *Remember, everything is removed from inside the car...including door panels and seats.

I have seen that treatment performed twice. The first time was when Son #1 was a toddler and dragged out Mrs. j's 12 inch by 12 inch by 1 1/2 inches thick maple cutting board from under the kitchen sink and dropped it on the big toe of his left foot. Took him to the pediatrician and the doctor laid him on his work bench, straightened out a paper clip, heated it with a match and melted through his toe nail. Worked liked charm.

The second time was when I whacked my left thumb with a hammer while I was playing carpenter one Saturday. Hurt like hell and got worse as the day progressed. By about midnight I had enough and decided to go to the hospital. The emergency room doctor took one look at my thumb and said, ""I have a fix for that, you're gonna feel a lot better in a minute"". He got out a paper clip and used a Bunsen Burner to heat it up and when he melted through the nail, my thumb felt better instantly, but it was a little humorous to see the fountain of blood dance up and down a few times as the pressure was relieved. I remember saying to the doctor that I expected a little more sophisticated treatment from a hospital to which he said, ""Why? This has probably been done for centuries. If it ain't broke we don't fix it. I couldn't begin to tell you how many times I've done this"".

My first concert that I went to was Carole King and James Taylor round about 1971. Loved it! The next show was Rod Stewart and Faces. Whoa! Loud rock and roll. In 1974 I went to go see Foghat at Hec Edmundson Pavilion at the U of Washington. Double, triple WHOA. Loud and bluesy rockin' that got my feet a movin'. Same thing with Burton Cummings and The Guess Who. Burton's great voice and piano combined with catchy love songs made them my 2nd favorite band, following only Foghat as my favorite band. I didn't discover Canada's Tragically Hip until 1997 - once Gordon Downie's catchy-rowdy vocals and the band's great guitar and drumming became entrenched in my mind, that band became locked in to my 3rd spot for all-time favorite rock bands.

I think the 60's were too cutesy, the 80's too detached and weird sounding for the most part. My fave decade for rock and just great music in general was the 1970's.

My right index finger got pinched by the bar, thankfully not all the way in but just on the outside of the bar where the blades are angled away.

I was wearing gloves and and they weren't cut so aside from the pinch didn't think anything of it. But it kept throbbing so after a minute I took a look and saw that it had cracked the fingernail partway down in the middle and it was bleeding underneath. I think the nail actually was what caused the cut under it. Blood was seeping quite a bit so I went inside to try to apply some antiseptic and try to get it stopped. That took a while as it was stubborn. Finally got several bandaids arranged on it to abate it and went back out to clean up. A couple of hours later I gripped something and it started bleeding again, so a new regime of bandaids was pressed into service. So far so good ever since.

The new one is considerably lighter than the former, so it is easier to use overhead on tall shrubs, etc. I was doing that and reached up with it in one hand, then went to put a second hand on it, and missed both the handle and the guard somehow. My right index finger got pinched by the bar, thankfully not all the way in but just on the outside of the bar where the blades are angled away. I was wearing gloves and and they weren't cut so aside from the pinch didn't think anything of it. But it kept throbbing so after a minute I took a look and saw that it had cracked the fingernail partway down in the middle and it was bleeding underneath. I think the nail actually was what caused the cut under it. Blood was seeping quite a bit so I went inside to try to apply some antiseptic and try to get it stopped. That took a while as it was stubborn. Finally got several bandaids arranged on it to abate it and went back out to clean up. A couple of hours later I gripped something and it started bleeding again, so a new regime of bandaids was pressed into service. So far so good ever since. It is in a spot where it is easy to disturb so I am trying to be careful. Just glad it wasn't a lot worse.
Glad your not really hurt. Just keep an eye on it because pressure can build up under the nail if it doesnt bleed out enough. ","ab348 said:

Ouch, ab.  So sorry to hear of your mishap.  As you described the incident, it brought back many memories of similar incidents in my life.  Just a simple movement or sticking a finger or a toe in the wrong place at the wrong time can result in the oddest injury.

Got to be careful with injuries to a fingernail or a toenail as infection can set in quickly.  I would suggest getting some additional first aid stuff like gauze, tape, peroxide, antibiotic ointment and some specialty bandaids.  Ya never know when it will happen again. ","@ab348, you definitely dodged a bullet. Nothing makes you feel more like a dope than when you do something like that. Don't ask how I know that. Just keep it clean until it scabs over and you should be fine. Again, don't ask me how I know that.

Good luck and let us know how it's going in a few days.

Dr. jmonroe","You learn something every day:
To determine how many clowns can fit in the car, it’s simple math. It’s a volume calculation. An American Standard Clown (ASC) is 5’ 8” tall and weighs 158 pounds. Each clown takes up approximately 3 cubic feet of space. A completely bare clown car probably has about 120 cubic feet of total space for clowns. So about 40 clowns should be able to fit in a clown car. But there are other factors, such as clowns need to breath, the need to exit the car quickly, and the use of props. Therefore, a typical clown car fits between 14 and 21 clowns with their props.
*Remember, everything is removed from inside the car...including door panels and seats.","Ab, Close call, bad enough but it could be worse. I think that you should consider that a wake up call. Be extra careful when handling anything dangerous. Be defensive, when driving, and when pruning.","

Take a look at this setup! I was trolling Ebay looking at some B&W speakers and looked at a listing with this listening room. Wow, I could get used to that. Other pictures show the speakers bi-wired with Nordost cables.","
Why? I'm never opening the stupid thing.","


Nice- McIntosh electronics. No center channel, however.","Oldfarmer, I have an older iPad which Apple will not process system updates. Edmunds made the recent change I couldn't sign on and was forced to use my Surface. I tried this morning on the iPad, no luck. After clearing all history I was able to sign in. Perhaps this is the issue you're experiencing?","I had to clear history/cookies on my Iphone for something else (7+ running the latest IOS) and it took me about 4 different sign ons before I was in. So odd, but at least it works!","I found that odd too. I'm thinking this is mostly a 2 channel set up and the TV is just there.

There is another set of speakers behind the rig. Maybe he has something in wall above the TV? Who knows, but an impressive setup.

Wife has our house rocking right now during her meal prepping for the week, love my B&Ws. Her music... not so much.",Wow. Does that system take up a lot of space. Ancient of days!,"That pic of the audio setup made me chuckle. I used to be a gear junkie years ago though nothing quite like that, always in search of the perfect sound. I finally discovered it is impossible and after a while I lost interest. These days pretty much the only music I listen to is in the car.

Part of the reason is the music itself. I recognize I am now an old guy and the music one grew up with is what you tend to like, but the industry is a shell of what it once was and most of the stuff produced these days is crap I do not enjoy. Last night I watched CNN's ""The 2000s"" series episode ""I Want My MP3"" about music in that decade and it was just depressing. Between the talking heads they had on saying how this or that hip-hop performer or that producer was groundbreaking I just had to shake my head. But it got no better when they went into other performers in the decade like Arcade Fire, Taylor Swift and then things like Deadmau5. A couple of years ago one of the ""progressive"" local pols convinced the city to book Deadmau5 for the annual Natal Day (municipal birthday) summer concert, which is usually a family event. The grounds filled and people over 30 in the audience for the most part were absolutely baffled. The world has changed and I no longer want to listen to it.","60's music is the best........then it jumped the shark around late 70's.
That was happier music, music you could sing along with, music you could identify with.","



Might as well turn your whole house into a speaker.","I think every era has some good music, and a bit of garbage too. Even the dinosaur days of the 70s

jmonroe","I find I like a mixture of music on SiriusXM of 50s, 60s, Yacht, SoulTown channels.

Actually I like a Canada station in Toronto, of all places. LOL. 740 AM Zoomer Radio. I pick it up at night on my radio when I wake up in the middle of the night. I'd love to be able to stream and capture what I hear there. From when music was music?

Their daytime schedule weekdays has some hours that suit me too. After 1 am they just load a hundred songs and play them.

http://www.zoomerradio.ca/
http://www.zoomerradio.ca/schedule/","I have all of the Sirius ""decades"" in my presets, from 40s through 90s. There can be something good in each, and I notice I stop at the 90s - that might be my cut-off, like how the prior generation cuts off at the 70s. For new music, I mostly tolerate only electronic material (there's a Sirus channel for that, too) - I can safely say plenty of people over 30 listen to Deadmau5, at least on the west coast. Some non-NA market material is also cool, I have a thing for German hip-hop, which is little like American hip-hop aside from name.

I've recently found a number of excellent streaming radio stations, and with bluetooth streaming in the car, my Sirius days may be numbered - my plan is up in December, we'll see if they make me a big offer, or let me walk.","
I have listened to 740 for many years. Since new owners bought it about 8 years ago it has become a place to promote Zoomer stuff....the same way AARP uses their club to sell to seniors. But, it is free and I will take it for what it is. I do the same though...if up in the middle of the night I can put my headset on and have song after song play - usually puts me back to sleep.","I think rock music broke off into a lot of segments in the 70's, so besides the 70's channel that reflects the Top 40 portion, you probably also need a classic rock station to hear some of the other stuff from that decade. The 70's didn't just spawn disco, it brought back country rock and brought in the emerging power rockers and ballads like Journey or Foreigner for example. Much better decade than the Top 40 stuff makes many people think...and this is coming from someone who grew up in the 60's, although personally I do prefer that decade overall.",What I have been up to the past few days in my spare time....,"

I listened to some of it and for all the world it sounds like the early computer ""music"" (really just a sequence of sounds) people used to play with on PCs in the '80s and early '90s. More of a technical accomplishment than artistry IMO, like someone who writes a very good payroll program, but whatever. I suppose anything can sound good if one is medicated enough.","LOL.

I would say that for rock the late 50's through the early 70's was the best, for country it was the 70's. ","Amusingly enough, the computer music goes back even further, I think this was a bit of a hit in 1972:



Maybe the first electronic hit was ""Telstar"" from 1962?

I am sure Fred Mertz and George Wilson were saying the same about rock in 1955

",OK it's name that car time again (yes I found myself at another car show).,"I think there are several Sirius channels for various forms of classic rock - not my thing though. I'd actually rather listen to disco - it's good for driving, and can be funny - but I am too young to remember it being a trend, and the eventual backlash against it, so maybe I have rose-tinted thoughts. For the power rockers, I like the 80s more - I can remember some of that. The 80s themed Sirius channel has a lot of sometimes dull Top 40 content too, but sometimes a gem slips through. With 20 presets and steering wheel controls, flipping through the channels is easy.
","CNN is not an arbiter of great music. They tend to trumpet the latest pop fads. That’s never been great stuff. There’s a lot of great music nowadays and a lot of junk too, same as always. For one thing, there’s much more Western exposure to African, Caribbean, and Latin sounds, so there’s a lot more interesting sounds possible.

I like it for light into the cabin and also occasionally carrying something tall. I don't open it very much due to wind noise.
The front moonroof opens all the way in my car - but the rear moonroof is sealed.  The rear passenger has a switch on either rear door that, when pressed, opens the rear top screen to allow sunlight in and enables the rear passengers to see out.  There are two audio speakers in the roof between the two moonroofs which are used as part of the surround sound system.

The only time I have opened the front moonroof is during the winter and spring months.  But I agree Shifty that the wind noise can be a bit obtrusive.","i open mine all the time. Summer, winter, doesn't matter. can get a little noise at highway speeds but just turn up the radio and it goes away. Around town, no issue. And I always keep the shade open (unless really getting sun angling in funny). I like the light it brings in, and love having the fresh air when I can.

nice in the winter too. Open the roof, put on the bun warmers and heat from the floor vents, and get a nice refreshing outdoor experience. Of course, when I had the Miata, as soon as the temp broke 41 (the temp that Mazda said it was OK to fold it), the top was down. windows up and heat one (and driving gloves) and it was perfect."," Man trying to catch up and hear, have to be signed up good to go though.

When I was a young whippersnapper, I used to fly down to Miami frequently to visit my grandparents. They owned a home in Coral Gables from 1947-1961.  My grandfather drove a 1949 Oldsmobile 98 and my grandmother drove a 1948 Chevrolet Coupe (fastback), both in black.

I used to see lots of ragtops down here during those times.  In 1971, my parents bought a condo in far North Miami Beach, a stone’s throw from Ft. Lauderdale airport.  I used to visit with my wife and kids a couple of times a year from Chicago.  At that time, there were still lots of ragtops.

Nowadays, I hardly see convertibles down here.  I believe it is due to the higher incidence of skin cancer and the fact that May through late October, it’s just too darn hot and humid.  Even at night, our lows are in the low 80’s and very humid.

We have learned, a convertible isn't all that it is cracked up to be.

Did you see the quotes in the IRS People? Of course IRS doesn't call you about your bad return, but sends you a letter first. It's the Nigerian, Indian, or home grown scam artists calling you to scare you that the Sheriff is on his way to arrest you, if you don't respond now.

In the old days of paper returns, I heard of people who were called legitimately, but only if they forgot a signature, or had some other technical issue with the forms. Essentially a courtesy call from the IRS to help you avoid late filing penalties, if you act. Those filing electronically would not experience that, as return gets rejected if there is something wrong with the technicals (e.g. wrong PIN) and you get an email. If there are actual questions about the income, deductions, etc. then you get letters, not phone calls.

By the way, three years ago somebody tried to file a return on my name (scamming a large refund, of course), but the IRS caught it themselves and rejected it. There was still some extra work, though. I couldn't file electronically that year, had to send a paper return with an affidavit, report the crime at my local sheriff's office. However, I still got the refund money fairly quickly, in couple of months. Since then they send me PIN valid for a particular tax year and now I can file electronically again. My colleague had similar problem and he still had an unresolved return after a year.","Convertibles are pretty much dead because many now want their creature comforts like AC and a quiet ride.

I think Fred was just way ahead of his time.",I just finished reading a book about golf with the very same quote from Freed Couples in it.,"
OTOH....I like a panoramic sunroof. First....I like the look of the black shiny roof. I like that there is a sunroof in the back and in the front.

I have half a mind not to tell you guys that I bought my convertible. It`s a 2000 Sebring, the last year with the Mitsu 6cyl engine. Sebrings were sludgemobiles for the next 6 years and were off my list. It`s a silver over black Limited trim level with leather and Infinity stereo. Even has a CD player which is cool for an 18 yo car. Paid about 8% of MSRP which is whereI like to be. Has 80,000 miles so I`m hoping it still has 50% of it`s life left for 8% of sticker. Appeals to my cheap nature.

I had to go 3 hours away to MA because the local offerings were junk including one where the seller took pictures from just the right angles to hide all the dents and defects.

I don't know what happens in next months. However, I know that no matter who was in power or what the economic policies were, if you take any 20-year period, stock market beats every market class. Take a 20-year ruler and slide it along the time line on Dow or S&P500 chart and you'll see it. This means of course that fortunately, so those two parties differ by a lot, yet not that much after all, in the grandest scheme of things. We didn't have anybody like Chavez or Mugabe in power, thank God (those numbers would have been different then). At least until now and let's how it stays that way.

So I'm not concerned about next rate hike, or next ""correction"" (BTW, why do we call a fall correction? What's so ""correct"" about a fall vs. raise, especially if the natural move is actually up?) or even ""bear market"". My accumulation and return period is still over 20 years.

Now, about rates - it's about time. I think it was quite unfair to punish savers in favor of spenders and deadbeats (this is a ""color"" commentary, I know it's more complicated than that) for this long. It's really not a matter of market returns, it's about fairness.","
I heard today that analysts say there is still 25-50% possible upside before the market turns. My money is in the same value type mutual funds that pay 2-5% dividends for the last 9 years.

I've averaged 10% yearly gains since 2009.","Mike I so badly wanted to get even with that jerk - it took tremendous willpower on my part to stop myself from a step below murder!

A few observations (by others):
1. Markets go up further then they fall, but they fall much faster than they climb.
2. Markets go up higher than we think is possible and they fall lower than we can imagine.

General dividend strategy is good, but one has to recognize dividends are not equal. You may have a hard reset in some industries that pay good dividends for a period of time, but face hardship. Oil companies recently. Essentially anybody who is highly cyclical (commodities) and/or has a lot of debt (REITs, consumer staples, telecoms) may at certain point face to need to cut a dividend. A mutual fund will hopefully ease the pain.","@oldfarmer50,

First of all yesterday, we got blitzed with an “IRS call”, but on my home phone, my cell phone, and Mrs. Carnaught’s cell phone. They were robo-calls with male and female voices, saying the IRS was taking me to court, and this was the last warning, and to call this number. Actually my wife called it, but her cell had a message, “scam likely”, and she went no further.. Have to admit I was kind of hoping there was a live body at the other end so I could bait them.

Today was the new low. Twice our home phone got a call showing on caller i.d., my name and phone number! Once we answered and no one was there. The second one was not answered and went to voicemail where no message was left. I did what I always do, I blocked the number. So, watch out for this new version.","

Review
Ive kept my upkeep on it up to date. Bought with 98k miles 5 years ago. Now has over 265k and its still going strong. Comfortable, and appealing, its a dream to drive!

There are others that aren't nearly as good. With a new car, your chances of a lemon are probably less than .05%, with a used 18 year old car with 80k miles, it is probably more like 40%. But, you did your homework...it will either be the buy of the century, or you will be out a few dollars......Good luck!

These guys are getting ahead of the telecoms, unfortunately. Caller ID is no longer useful, unless it's your friend you are waiting for. The spoofing technology is just too good for the authorities. Yesterday a lady called me ""who is this"", ""who IS THIS"", ""You called me"", ""No I didn't"". Then I explained to her she was probably called by a scammer who spoofed my number.

It's really a bigger and bigger nuisance. Seems like those extended warranty calls are another breed of scammers, not just overly aggressive businesses. I wonder the angle - is it about immediate payment that goes to nowhere? The ""IRS People"" call me on my home, usually every three months. They usually leave a message with a robovoice. As you said, by the time you call back, the number is already disconnected, so those guys are really ineffective. You'd have to call them right away to be scammed.","Could somebody give jmonroe and oldfarmer an easy quick way to get on Insider.

I did call the 1-800 number on the credit card and I was able to talk to a nice lady who probably lives in India and was a bit hard to understand, but, she was able to help me out.","
Odd because most ""experts"" say the IRS won't call you. They will send a letter first. However, On tax forms, including a 1040x I just filed, they want your phone number... So if they have questions about the 1040x simple change during the 16 weeks they say it can take to process a 1040x are they going to call me? (17 weeks? What are they doing that they can't do a reprocess of a simple individual return.)

Someone mentioned State Farm. I had them. After having to use them, they were the most arrogant, obstinate and unhelpful insurance company I’ve ever encountered. I dropped them like a hot potato.

It’s not just their local people who succumb to this. This stems from corporate on down.

@iluvmysephia1 ...no surprise the dealer is taking that Sentra to auction. I would like to see what it sells for with a “manufacturer buy back title”. Some dealer will take another chance on it. But, I’d be willing the selling price will be south of 5 figures. Still not sure that would be any sort of deal on that car.

Speaking of Buy Backs, as if on cue, I got a call from the guy who sold me my last CTS last night to tell me about all the programs Cadillac has going on right now. Understand, this guy not only sold me the car (to replace the other Cadillac with problems) and worked with me on all the paperwork that needed for a couple of weeks. He also was involved with me for the months my other Cadillac was in their shop and all the paperwork GM wanted before writing me the buy back check. In brief, we had spent quite a bit of time together.

Anyway, I asked him why he would even think of calling me to try to get me into the dealership for a new car. He feigned ignorance and claimed he didn’t know about the troubles I had with my CTS(s). I replayed all the troubles, transactions, the paperwork we had to go through, the weeks and months we communicated back and forth. He said he remembers none of it.

I left him with “I don’t think you’re senile. But, make it a point to erase my phone number, my email, my address from your list”. Anyone who doesn’t remember that entire fiasco, isn’t someone I’d likely do business with again.” I did tell him to have a good day, and wished him good luck.

It does have a lot to do with where you live. When I lived out in the boonies, my car insurance was really cheap. Now, inside the loop, it is much more expensive. But that's actually understandable. I lived out in the boonies for 10 years, never had a single claim. 8 years in the city, 3 claims (twice I was ran over, and once had the hood stolen). People living in the city, especially the inner city, are going to have more claims. Therefore, you're going to pay more for car insurance.

USAA was the cheapest when I lived out in the boonies, by quite a margin. Now they're not, but they are within reasonable distance of the cheapest quotes. So I will just stay where I am, and keep enjoying their great service.

I have no idea why USAA doesn't like South Florida. I know that a lot of their members are retired military living in Florida, so I would think they would favor Florida.","

I circled the entire parking lot and finally found someone getting ready to back out of a spot.  So I put my flashers on waiting for them to put their groceries into their trunk.

They finally pull out and I turned off my flashers on put on my right directional signal to let the car behind me that I was making a right turn into that spot.  Before I knew it, this young man pulls around me and drives into the spot.  I missed hitting him by inches.

I got out of my car to confront him for “stealing” my parking space.  An employee who picks up shopping baskets in the lot saw the whole thing and as I begin to admonish him along with the Publix employee, he gives both of us the “bird” and told us to f..k ourselves and left to go into the store.

The Publix employee said that this happens frequently in the parking lot and had often missed being hit by cars rushing into parking spaces.

When he left, I seriously thought of revenge - taking my house key and carving a response to his actions and foul mouth using his side door for my message.  But, I got realistic about the possible consequences to that revenge strategy and got back in my car and found another spot in the next row of cars.

Now I ask you all - don’t thoughts of mayhem against a “felonious crumb” like that young man dash through your thoughts in order to punish someone for treating you badly and taking what was rightfully yours?

They really hate your gut there, Mike. My insurance never crossed equivalent of $1450/yr (typically my insurers sell 6 month coverages), but for years I've had more like 1100-1200, sometimes less. My coverages are typically highest offered liability, standard 500 deductible and reduced uninsured. My PIP portion is usually the smallest.

But there are some insurers that hate me, too. Liberty has never come with anything remotely competitive, Geico has always been higher. One or two other also came with some rates out of their rear ends. I've had best prices with Progressive, Travelers and Ameriprise, until the last one jacked up my premium by 50 percent on nothing other than me refinancing the house. I think they just simply wanted out, as later they pulled out from new policies altogether. There was a ramp up in fraud in Florida in both home and auto policies and some insurers drastically pulled their horns. It seems to have normalized since, at least here. One time I got Allstate, but they jacked up prices after a year by 20 percent, then another 20 on the very next renewal (just 6 months after the first jackup), so I thanked them.

I always wondered how different businesses can have so different risk models that come up with 50-100 percent spreads in rates for the same product for the same people.","

Yep. Back when I drove my C20 on a regular basis, and cars were generally more durable, I dealt a few times with people who would steal a designated parking spot I had for a couple years. I got to where I would just park behind them with my bumper to theirs, go into my building and call the local police shop to ticket them. They would get a $75 fine, which was a lot back in the 90s (comparatively), then wait for them to return. When they would, I would go down, admonish them for their actions, move out of the way, let them go, and then park.

I had a lot more time on my hands back then.

Another time, I had this little car park so close to me that I couldn't get into my truck. I had to go around the passenger side and slide over. Once I was in, I backed out, pulled up behind them, and pushed the car over the bump stop. It was a low car, so it rested on the stop (e.g., likely high-centered). I got a great laugh about that one, but did not stick around to see what the reaction was.","
Today had an MDX pass on the right because I and the two cars sort of behind me were only going 70 in the 65 zone immediately outside the 55 zone on the interstate.

He then made two more lane changes 1 mile up and I was stopped behind him at the stoplight on the ramp to go to one of the Walmarts.

The problem I find with Allstate is I have no idea what their invoices mean.....they give you a high rate, then subtract for all kinds of things, having ABS, having blind spot monitoring, no accidents, having air bags, for being a long term customer (sucker) etc....and with all the extra savings........my rates keep going up and I think they are higher than if I switched...if I could find someone.

Then I tried AARP and went through a lengthy questionaire and they ended up being $90 more. The guy said but ""Don't you want to support AARP"". I said ""Not really, I couldn't care less about AARP except the discounts I get at hotels and restaurants""",I often wonder what AARP actually does for seniors in any meaningful way.,"
He just told you! Discounts at hotels and restaurants!","
How is ""forums.edmunds.com"" different from ""forums.edmunds.com""?","
Excellent question. I don't believe it's anything much at all. If it weren't for the hotel discounts, I wouldn't bother with them.","
They also have great ads for very simple computers that seniors can use.....and cell phones with large buttons that have huge numbers....and you can only use them for actually calling people.","
For my $10 a year I get a nice insulated bag to carry drinks etc., and I save on hotels....and 15% at Denny's. The Canadian version, called CARP, does do some lobbying for seniors, and does try to pass legislation that is beneficial to seniors. The Canadian one has gotten some beneficial legislation passed.......and, I think it is a good idea to have someone looking out for our interests. To be fair, they do have some excellent articles in their newspaper too....about managing money and health issues.","If I switch and they decide to jack my rates up later, I just search anew and switch again. I really would rather just stay with my current place through AAA, but they are higher (a lot) across the board on both policies. Guess because I have been with them for 4 years, I am old news.

could call them back to ask for a better rate, but have never had luck with that. They would rather let you walk than negotiate.","we were with Allstate for years actually in the past. Only switched when our son got his license. Stopped at the agent to have him added, and they gave me the new amount. Was a little higher than hoped for, but not too much, so I was going to live with it. Until I discovered that was the increase for him, not the total. I almost had a heart attack. Switched to Liberty for barely any increase.

I forget the exact numbers, but something like we were paying $2000/yr, and they wanted an additional $3,000 just for him.

Agent did say that we were the exact demographic they wanted. Old, boring, don't drive much. Pretty much free money to them.","
That is one thing I find surprising with these companies: They really don't care about your loyalty at all. I have a separate policy on my Q7 than the rest of my fleet, because insuring that car through my primary Allstate policy, which I have had for 21 years, is just insanely expensive. Through State Farm, I pay almost exactly half the amount they wanted for it, and I have better coverage. The only benefit I really see to the Allstate policy is that I have had it so long that I qualify for ""unlimited accident forgiveness."" Basically, they have fleeced me so much over the years that they won't drop me or raise my rates due to claims (or so they say). Also, when asking about the prospect of adding my son to my policy, it was only about 15% higher than adding a car myself. In other words, shockingly reasonable!","Let’s face it. The insurance companies have to charge a lot. They have to pay for all that advertsing, all the commercials coming in between those for medications.","
DOH! I knew that.","From WikiPedia:

According to the group's official history, Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus founded AARP in 1958. AARP evolved from the National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA), which Andrus had established in 1947 to promote her philosophy of productive aging, and to promote health insurance for retired teachers. After ten years, she opened the organization to all Americans over 50, creating AARP.[8] Today, the NRTA is a division within AARP.[9]

Critics of AARP offer an alternative version of the group's origins. 60 Minutes reported in a 1978 exposé that AARP had been established as a marketing device by Leonard Davis, founder of the Colonial Penn Group insurance companies, after he met Ethel Percy Andrus.[10] According to critics, until the 1980s AARP was controlled by Davis, who promoted its image as a non-profit advocate of retirees in order to sell insurance to members.[11] Possibly as a result of this report, AARP conducted a competitive bidding process, and, in 1980, shifted the insurance contracts available to members to Prudential Financial.[12]

In the 1990s, the United States Senate investigated AARP's non-profit status, with Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, then chairman of the United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy, questioning the organization's tax-exempt status in congressional hearings. According to Charles Blahous, the investigations did not reveal sufficient evidence to change the organization's status,[13] though in an interview years later by the Des Moines Register, Senator Simpson remained ""troubled by AARP's practices"", calling AARP ""the biggest marketing operation in America and money-maker"" and an organization whose practices are ""the greatest abuse of American generosity I witnessed in my time in the U.S. Senate"".[14]","I have no opinion on the matter myself, and I don't belong.

And, they do advocate for seniors. It is what it is.....not a huge fan, but, no reason to mock it either (not you henryn, but 60 Minutes looking for a fake news story etc)","
Meant to edit......but, I'll add it here.....besides, how would seniors find out about simple to use computers


The big, bright screen is easy to see and push button navigation makes getting around a snap. The touch screen makes learning how to use the WOW! Computer so much more intuitive too - you can simply reach out and touch what you want to do. Also, for people who may have physical challenges like arthritis, for instance, using a keyboard and mouse may prove difficult. These users often find the touch screen much more accessible because they can simply touch the icons on the screen to get going.","Isn't State Farm a mutual insurance company - owned by its members instead of a publicly traded corporation? If so, they may issue dividends to their insured annually which should be considered a reduction in the insured's net out of pocket cost annually. It can be hard to compare these things sometimes. I know USAA issues a dividend to an insured's holder account each year, but the amount varies annually based on overall claims claims payouts and the like for that year.","Dudes, Bill Luke Chrysler of Tempe took the '17 Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed selling for only $11,598 away to auction.

Well, that's okay. You took your turn last year, right? Would you rather it be bearing down there again?","When my body shop let me know the damage was mostly superficial and wouldn't require any replacement parts he went on to share that many insurance companies, particularly the big national won't spring for OEM parts...even if it's the same or last model year. To those who lease that may not matter unless but if a buyout was planned but or if the vehicle was purchased I could see why people would be upset with that policy. My insurance company, which is regional, will allow shops to use OEM parts for the current and past 2 model years so I would have been fine had it needed anything.","I had a call today from ""Dealer Services"". I had a bad feeling when I saw the 927 area code.......and when he stumbled and had to look for my name.
Then he said, ""This is Dealer services, calling about your Volkswagon Passat....."" and that is when I said we traded in that car 2 years ago.....and then hung up.
I didn't waste my time telling him to take me off their list, I have told them that every month for the last 2 years","When the hood was stolen off my new F150 (less than a year old), I took it in to the Ford dealers body shop. They were not ""approved"" by USAA, which means that an adjuster had to go by the shop, look at the truck, and approve their estimate. But it was fixed, and fixed right, with Ford parts, and USAA had no problem with that. It did take a few extra days (because of the need for the adjuster to go by the body shop), but I was in a rental car and was in no great hurry.

USAA treats you right. It would take a really really big (something?) to make me ever consider any other insurance company.","When my wife and I got married we went with my insurance company, Erie, versus hers which was AAA.

One of the worst ""sayings"" is that ""time is money"" No. Money is elastic--you can ""get"" more if you need it, or spend less and have more money. Time is inelastic--you never had less time in your life than you have now available to you. You can't ""get"" more time. These two things can't be equal or ""balanced"".
I am going to challenge you on this. Time is money because we exchange our time for money, for some of us our time is more valuable then others and some can maximize the value of their time.

Case in point, on Friday my employer will deposit money into my bank account. They are doing it because I gave them my time. Now as you say I can get more money but to do that I must spend time. 

Now this is time I am giving to someone else doing what they want me to do in exchange for money. If I want more money I have to either make my time more valuable or expend more time.

Remember that this is time I am not spending on myself. 

So since we exchange our time for money time is money.","I think he maybe meant that in the economic sense of ""elasticity"".

REally all he’s doing is regurgitating common sense finances. Don’t spend more than you have to and certainly not more than you have. Don’t pay interest charges. Live below your means not above them.

But, there’s no “cookie cutter” strategy that fits all the people all the time. Yes, there are certain things to adhere to (like the above), but I’ve been known to extend myself a bit for an asset that I thought would appreciate quite a bit (like some stocks and certainly when I bought my first house).

As these things go, there are exceptions to every rule. If a car has a rebranded title, but it’s cheap, you probably don’t have much financial exposure with it if a catastrophe happens. Same goes for older cars. Those may not matter one way or the other if they have a rebuilt title or not.

The amusingly emotional and somewhat strawman use of ""evil"" and ""castigate"" speaks volumes. Some out there want to return to a time when things were ""great"", why not also return to its tax policies and socio-economic spectrum? The gap is much wider now than then.

There is no credible data in the world that shows the trickle down fantasy actually produces positive results - yet some will run with it to their dying days. What percentage of wealth is held by those ""evil top 10"" (really??), and how was it attained? It's not exactly an unfair system for that segment, definitely much more favorable here than in other (quasi) developed areas.

Definitely we are not overtaxed, some of us much less than others. Nobody said we are overtaxed. We pay little, and receive little in return, relative to peers in other locations. That's the Murkan way, bootstraps, temporarily embarrassed millionaires, medical bankruptcy, etc. It works well for some, while others are left behind.

Good luck reducing SS in this day and age, when due to wage stagnation, increasing living costs not factored into inflation numbers, and a Gatsbyesque socio-economic chasm, many simply can't afford to save for the future, and because pensions now don't exist save for citizens deluxe working for public agencies and a few remaining industries, SS is all some will have. Political suicide, nobody would run with it. Regarding anything medical, eventually there will be real pressure for some form of single payer system.

It's interesting to see the insane lack of self-awareness from some demographics out there, usually those kept afloat by family or public sector largesse, who think they built something themselves. Entitlements, both in numbers and mentalities, go both ways.

At some point, the people who lent the government the money, might look at this enormous debt and say ""you know, I'm not so sure the government is going to be able to pay all this back""

That's when ""austerity"" kicks in---for you, not for them.","
This is spot on. I hear people complaining about roads, schools, all kinds of bad services and then adding in the second breadth that they ""paid enough"" taxes. But think about it, if about 25 percent of the people (or sometimes more) make a living based on government paying them directly (employees, retirees, welfare) or indirectly (contractors, subsidized industries), even if a portion of it recirculates back (taxes on wages and services), do people honestly believe they ""paid enough"" to have good/great schools, infrastructure, safety net for those in need and the enormous military this country maintains all over the world and sends to wars practically every ten-fifteen years? I just don't think so. The math simply doesn't add up, but nobody wants to hear about it. We will all pay some day. Probably not tomorrow, probably not day after, but ""some day"" may be sooner than anybody thinks. And it will not be announced. It's just like the old aristocrats, who were always ""good for it"", until the debtors ask ""how about now"".","

Exactly what I said; I don't think that the Sentra is a bad car, but I think it's mid-pack in its market segment at best.

Here's how I'd respond to the above: if I really wanted the Nissan Versa S still, or a Chevy Spark, or a Nissan Sentra S, I would really have to pick the Ford Focus ST in a heartbeat and be done.

I love changing the dials - I love planning a road trip out. I love maintaining my car like the finely-built specimen it is. I like my cars to run like tops. I like listening to ZZ Top's 'Fandango' album in my car as I drive to go see ZZ Top. I like driving safely - I like preserving life. I love cars. I love the looks of the cars I buy. Sure, the Ford Focus ST is a fine looking car and I may decide on one eventually. I'm just not a racer - I'd rather stop and read the historical road signs alongside the road. This country's chock full of history and I hate missing out on some good history along the way. Having said that about not needing to race, I do remember driving my Lancer GTS in Tucson with it's heavy cross-town traffic. The Lancer GTS had a 152-hp 148-ft.lb. of torque 4-cyl. engine with an automatic CVT transmission with paddle shifters. I would as a practice rev up that engine and get myself out of some of the nastiest traffic jams and pull out in front - way out in front with a jubilance of Shawn Kemp when dunking the ball off of Michael Jordan's head in the '96 NBA Finals. VAROOOMMM!!! That Mitsubishi motor could be wrung out with a fairly quick succinction of power on the spot to get away from nasty pools of traffic. That and U-Turns: Tucson is the city of U-turns. My point about this is that I sometimes enjoy a little road racing - a burst of power to get in and out of the holes on the road like a hard-running NFL halfback. It's run. This Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed would give me that power for quick city-burst getaways. I'd spin them with glee. I'm not totally immune to the appeal of driving a car hard and I'm somewhat interested in track driving - just not enough to pursue it with immediate abandon. That's all. It could be learned and I could see it being sort of a obsessive compulsive disorder buzz of some kind - the kind that the Ford Focus ST would deliver in an instant. Ford engineers have done a marvelous job with the Focus ST - I'm really proud of them. It's a shame they're poop-canning car production for the U.S. I hope they change their minds on that decision.

The 2017-18 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo is 188hp coming in at 5600rpm and 177 ft.lb. of torque that comes in at a low 1600rpm (that stays flat all the way up to 5200rpm) contained in this engine Nissan took out of their Juke: a 1.6L 4-cyl direct-injected gasoline turbocharged engine. That is coupled with an intercooler and a compression ratio of 10.5:1, all linked with a 6-speed transmission.

Motoman's YouTube video on the 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed: Part II of III

As I was describing earlier, I don't live to race. Simply put it boils down to what the car has - which, to me, is a lot of cool body design and a smart interior layout with loads of room in the backseat for guest riders as well as the Mrs. and I in the front. Plus, what I think is a killer body design. This is my Datsun 510 sedan in 2018 form. The 510 is the subcompact that Nissan took and made the Sentra design off of - I knew there was something cool about the Sentra that was lingering around, thick and deep with history - well, that's it - it's continuously harkening my mind back to the late 60's with 411 Bluebird and 510 imagery fleshed out in 2017-2018 as the Sentra. It's subtle yet firm as a swift take down from someone like Dennis Rodman under the Detroit Piston frontcourt. Right up and in my face, car nuts!


Reliability has been good for the Sentra - the 2017-18's no exception. The SR Turbo 6-speed I save for will be like the one I detailed last night with the lighting kit for automatic fade-in and fade-out lighting upon entry, special SR Turbo stitching on the doors and floormats, on-board tech package and rear-view camera, sunroof, heated front seats, foglights up front and a small spoiler out back that gives a subtle splay off the taillights and separation up above the Nissan Sentra trim in back. I think it's slightness works well back there and adds to the design instead of some of the ridiculous spoilers of the past. My 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS had a larger spoiler, but Mitsu pulled it off by designing the taillights to pry down and up to the right at the rear corners. Design like that isn't stumbled upon - it's earned by doing it right. Just right.















So, in conclusion of this little pamphlet I've made, roadburner - I can understand where you're coming from on the immediate speed-mobile thing - the Ford Focus ST would be a natural there. If you have time, though, watch Motoman's Part II of III video I have plopped up above on the 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-spd stick.

We can relitigate things many times, if you wish. The facts are that 70 percent of revenue from income tax in 2015 was coming from those evil top 10 of earners, almost 38 percent of revenue from the most evil 1 percent. Their participation in total income is much smaller. Of course, to be fair, you'd need to add FICA taxes, which would shuffle the percentages a bit in favor of the lower brackets, but the facts remain.

So I would like you at least say ""thank you"" to those people who actually keep this country afloat, not vilify them. After that we can have rational discussion, whether or not it may be good for them to chip in more to shore up our nation's ailing balance sheet, not just demand they pay more because they're evil and owe the rest of us everything they've got. No can do? That's where the problem lies. Ideology trumps the facts, for both sides.

I don't think we are particularly overtaxed. Anybody who lived a day abroad knows we are not. But I do think we are spending too much, not just on military. We have grossly overpromised to future seniors (including myself in the future), particularly in Medicare, also a bit in Social Security. It's really startling when you hear that it will me middle of next decade already when the funds go insolvent (i.e. payments exceed receivables and zero savings on the account), yet everybody is acting like it's not there. Ignoring it only going to make the hammer fall harder. I already assume that if I get 75% of my currently calculated SS (adjusted for inflation), I'll be a lucky man. If you ever looked at your own Medicare statement and see how much you paid into the system (I did), including your employer's contribution and compare it with costs of care and rate of consumption amongst people over 65, the numbers miss each other not by 10 or 20 percent, they miss each other by factor of three or four, even if you adjust for people who will never consume it (died prior eligibility). It's a joke, but not very funny. It can't be fixed by raising the tax, there is no amount that can shore that up without killing the economy. The only way to fix it is to do both - raise the rates a little and rework the entitlement promise (yes, reduce it). But anobody, who raises the issue in its earnest, tries to propose any rational changes, is vilified as pushing grandma from the cliff.","
Stick....my sister never did tell me the numbers, as I warned her against buying anything without a clean title. Apparently she mentioned something to our late Mother, bemoaning she lost “5 figures” on the car.

She shopped it around to BMW dealers and got no takers (not even an offer). She advertised it as a private owner car, and didn’t get any sniffs either (this was when CarFax was just strarting out and people could look up a car’s history).

She ended up selling it to another small used lot just to get some cash out of it."

I have (twice) bought cars - well, one car, one truck - with a rebuilt title.

The car was an older Cadillac, which had been side swiped, damage to the right rear door and the right rear fender. It was purchased (from the insurance company, at auction) by a guy who did body work on the side. The guy who fixed it up and sold it to me had pictures of the before and after, so that I could plainly see that it was only superficial body damage (not frame). I saved a lot of money, and my only two worries were that the bondo or the paint might come loose, and that my insurance company did not want to do collision and comprehensive. I paid so little for the car that I was willing to go with just liability insurance, and if the paint peeled off I could live with that. I drove that car for a couple of years, never had any problems with the body work, and sold it for more than I paid for it.

The truck was stolen and stripped, not wrecked, not flooded, and the owner showed me proof of that. The original owner bought it back from the insurance company, who totaled it. He found a similar wrecked truck, bought the whole thing, transferred the seats, the tires and wheels, the stereo, the tailgate, a few other things. He kept it for several more years before he sold it to me. I got a very nice truck for a greatly reduced price. When I explained all of this to my insurance company, they had no problem selling me full coverage.

The only slightly weird thing, the seats were not a good color match for the interior door panels and other trim. Which didn't bother me, but I did get a few questions about that!","
I don't think he's insincere or a con man but a lot of what he propagates is, or at least should be, common sense to most people.

Also, his advice on car purchases is simple: 
1) Don't finance a car at all.
2) Buy your car with cash - and spend only 50% or less of your yearly income on that rig.","I would do salvage only on a cheap, older car. And only body damage or theft recovery that I had proof of the before. Basically stuff that would have been fixed if the car was newer. But not something that was still relatively expensive.

Back in the mid-late '90s I was Project Manager for the Province on a Personal Property Registry system - essentially a system where all liens would be recorded against anything that was used as collateral for borrowing, except for mortgages against real estate. Prior to that a lien against a car or a yacht would need to be recorded on paper in each of 17 registry offices around the province, which of course never happened and so it was pretty useless.

One of the things that I learned from that is as you say, some places in other parts of the world had no mechanism at all for such borrowing and so it was pretty limited and really hurt their economies. I went to a few conferences where people from places in South America, Africa and Asia were in attendance to try to figure out how to set something similar up for their countries. In fact the young lady I hired to be the provincial registrar here eventually went to work for the World Bank to help them do exactly that. She did very well for herself, at the cost of spending almost all her time in the Far East.","Life is too short for some of that, especially in terms of car purchases. It's all about priorities, and the way I see it, if outflow is less than income and a decent amount is being saved for later, it's fine. These are the good old days.

I still can't be in awe of someone for preaching what most of the time is simple common sense that should be easy for anyone who has a grasp of arithmetic. I was probably a little harsh in my initial description of Ramsey, but I can't see the mystique.

Both monthly loan payments on my Infiniti ($612.27) & my wife's Pilot ($538.17 after I put $10,500 down) exceed the ""all time high."" I wholeheartedly agree with you that as a society, we are addicted to debt. The nation's economy should depend on debt as much as it does. Watch what would happen if interest rates were suddenly raised 2 points. Auto sales? Home sales? Mortgages? That's just the tip of the iceberg. Big corporations use low interest to finance equipment, real estate, capital projects... The stock market would nose dive for sure.","

Everybody is a genius in a bull market, aren't they? I still relish some of Jim Cramer's incredibly wrong stock calls, as well as his god-awful advice in 2008.","
I assume things were similar in the US, but I remember up here in late 1980 and 1981 having interest rates on low-risk consumer debt at 18% and up. The company where I worked had set up a loan to buy a new IBM computer system and between the time that was done and the time the thing finally got delivered the rate jumped to over 20%. People were getting mortgages renewed at those rates too with a huge jump in their monthly payment. It was nuts.","
Quicken is one of the pieces of software I tend to give rave reviews to. Been using it since 1995, and I don't know if we'd have made it through things without it. My most eye-opening Quicken moment came when I entered about 6 months of bank statement data to get started and had to categorize things. Well, debit cards hadn't hit yet, and we would still go to the ATM and grab a $20 if we needed cash. So you'd get that $20 to buy the widget that was $11, and the other $9 would just disappear into the ether.

I was shocked that ATM withdrawals were 27% of our spending. Just being aware of that cut it down to about 12% immediately. Debit cards came around and got me below 3% shortly thereafter.

I really don't set up a budget using Quicken, although I DO look at how much we spend on what... which is kinda the same thing.","
I came across him and another guy this morning on some CNBC show. Cramer was doing body movements like a deranged person. Can't take that. Sometimes I watched his evening show just to see what he was recommending and now recommending. Hard to make sense out of his ramblings.","
I think it's fine to make money providing people what they need. I understand that Ramsay made most of his money before he became a radio host and his story was that as a young man he got rich ""quickly"" through real estate, then he lost it all due to over-leveraging, then he made it back the ""right way"", which of course took him more time. And he did what he advises, i.e. put himself through rice and beans, during the recovery time.

That's the thing with debt - it extends your gains in good times and magnifies losses in bad times. People (companies, too) go into debt in good times assuming that bad times will never come. I always say that when something bad happens to you, I believe if you tell me it was not your fault. But if you were financially unprepared to face that difficulty after years of holding a well paying job, years during which all you dealt with was regular life without extraordinary financially draining hardships (e.g. child with a disability, sick relative, or similar) , IT IS YOUR FAULT.","Exactly! The dealers around here advertise new STs for a minimum of $3500 off of MSRP.
I'd estimate that an ST is at worst 1,000,000% more fun to drive than the Sentra SR.

A Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed can go 0-60 in around 7.5 seconds. Depends on one's shifting skill. A 2018 Ford Focus ST 6-speed can go 0-60 in around 6.3 seconds. A 2011 Kia Soul 5-speed can go 0-60 in around 10 seconds. When I'm car shopping I'm not Mario Andretti-ing it up.

I want legroom in the back like the Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed has, industry leading in it's class. I want a certain body style look, it is a look that Nissan has designed-in to the Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed just right for me. I don't freak out about having a finely-tailored interior - colors of black and grey and plastics molded to look like metals work just fine for me. Piano black sprays and splays are cool but not required.

I also don't need industry-leading schnick-shifters. I need shifters that go to the spot they're supposed ta go and stay there. By all rights, the Ford Focus ST would work out better for me as my No.2 car. My play car.

The choice for me is the Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed. My hunting subjects have been nailed down to just one car. Made by one carmaker. It's the whole offering that needs to line up, with the Mrs. and I the cost of the car comes in to consideration, yes, as does ghastly mileage per gallon of ghastly.

So you remember it wrong. He was calling for everybody to get out for months. I have watched his show for years. He was the one of the first people on TV (not counting permabears, who were telling you to get out all the way from 2001) to tell the storm was coming. His infamous ""they know nothing"" meltdown was in September or August 2007, well before most people were aware there was something very wrong with the system. He did not change his tune until March 2009, which was the bottom.

In your ""bad advice"", you may be referring to the most misunderstood piece of talk television, i.e. a caller asking about Bear Stearns. People quote this as hims saying it was safe, as stock of Stearns day before the collapse (JP Morgan taking it ""under""). Would be pretty damning, if it only were true. The caller actually asked about his account in Stearns (I heard it live and I knew what he asked), not the stock. He said it was safe and IT WAS, as JP Morgan simply took it over. Best of all, the caller was asked couple of weeks later, after the the takeover went into effect, whether his money in was OK. But who cares about the truth. Cramer had some bad stock calls over the years, but he did a lot to warn people about banks all the way from 2007 to 2009.","The car companies are starting to listen to me.

The RS retails for around $41,000.

But the more inexpensive Ford Focus ST retails for something more like $25,000 and gets excellent reviews on YouTube, too. I really like the Ford Focus ST.



2018 is the last year Ford will offer the Focus ST in America.

I have also been looking at my other current favorite, the Nissan Sentra. My latest idea is to get a slightly used Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed. Here's one - a manufacturer buyback - at Bill Luke Chrysler in Tempe.








I've decided that I like the grey on the Sentra SR Turbo. It's got 7,686 miles on it. It's engine has 188hp, it is a 6-speed stick, sunroof, metal accents on the interior, rear view camera and it has the foglights up front. I pulled in to a Del Taco following one of these cars in black and it had my eye following it in. Looked nice. They incorrectly added NISMO on to the end of Turbo in one of their written descriptions of the car. It's not a NISMO - once again the dealer doesn't know what kind of car they're selling. It's price is $12,000 and this one even has heated front seats. I looked at the CarFax and wanted to see what the buyback was for. The owner had to take it in to get an oxygen sensor replaced and then apparently was annoyed about a check engine light. I have read up on manufacturer buybacks and apparently it doesn't always mean the rig is ""cursed"". Sometimes the car gets blamed for a dealer's service center waiting longer than usual for a part to come in, sometimes the service center doesn't fix a problem properly, etc. It's not just the car breaking down repeatedly leading to the ""lemon"" designation. The fix has been made already - more than just a few potential buyers would gawk and balk at the buyback designation and leave this one alone. It's heading to auction soon, the dealer says. These cars retail for $22,600. If I were to head to Tempe, AZ, from here to go test drive this car and I liked it, I would offer $11,000 tops and ask for a 6-year, 60,000 mile powertrain Warranty on this pup. If they would oblige me there, I'd trade in the Soul and get it. The Mrs. wants us to wait till my next birthday when I turn 60 and begin collecting my Boeing pension monthly payments, save for 12 months, then buy our next car in cash completely. Dave Ramsay philosophy - he absolutely has a conniption fit if someone buys a car over time. We took the 2011 Kia Soul in today and I wanted an oil change, plugs, plug wires, possibly a fuel filter and possibly an air filter. Martin Tire had me out the door with only an oil change. These guys are great - I love an honest tire and repair shop. I took my '08 Lancer GTS there and then this car after the '08 Lancer GTS' engine blew to smithereens. The Soul has 103,345 miles on it and yes, it's running well. It broke down a month or so ago and needed a crankcase sensor sending unit replaced to the tune of $360.61. All's well now - I'm ready to trade and take on a 60-month note. She's not. I know modern cars will go 150,000 miles now and really could go and should go 175,000 miles. The Kia Soul also broke down a year ago in Wenatchee - it turned out ta be a bad ignition switch and Wenatchee Kia had us fixed for only about $265 that time IIRC. Our Enterprise rental van - a 2017 Dodge Caravan GT, costed more by about a hundred dollars than the ignition switch repair came to! Truth be told - I'm getting more serious about trading in, y'all.

Whenever I really get serious about buying my next rig it'll be one of these babies. The 2013 Ford Focus ST with 61,000 miles on it selling for only $11,500 is gone from it's spot downtown here in Alamogordo. As it turns out, $11,500 is beyond a fair selling price for the hot-hatch. I think I would love driving the Focus ST - YouTube reviewers sometimes yelp in excitement as they drive the car - two or three of them have!

Would anyone yelp in excitement driving a 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo 6-speed? Ahh...I might.","Warranty or not, you'd have to be categorically insane to buy a car that's been branded as a ""manufacturer's buyback.""

@iluvmysephia1 ....funny about the descriptions of “rebuilt titles” or “manufacturer buybacks”. They always act like they bought the cars back was for a minor issue to make the customer happy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Manufacturers loath to buy back a vehicle and will fight tooth and nail to keep from doing so. They’ll also throw their (considerable) legal and corporate weight around trying to wear down a customer so they just give up pursuing a buyback.

I’m absolutely certain the buyback on that Sentra was more than just replacing an O2 sensor. There’s more to it....a lot more to it, I’m certain. Don’t succumb to the dealership feigning they don’t know what they have. They know exactly what they have. Sounds like they were trying to add to the pot by knowing and incorrectly stating it was a NIMSO, when it really wasn’t.

My younger sister fell for one of those “rebuilt title” cars a few years ago. She found a 1 year old 3 series with a rebuilt title that seemed like a steal. It wasn’t being sold by a dealership, but by a local used car lot (which I wasn’t familiar with). They told her the car had a rebuilt title because the original owner left his window open during a rain storm because the window regulator broke.

She said there was no evidence of a wreck (which was true), and that the used car lot only had to replace the window regulator to give the car a clean bill of health. Fast forward 4 months later when the electrics were giving her all sorts of fits. She finally took it to my BMW dealership who found dampness and water under the carpets, behind the door cards, under the trunk mat, etc. They said it looked like it had been in a flood.

Digging around a bit, found out it originally came from the east coast and was one of the cars that was affected by the super storm Sandy. Tracing it back, the car was totaled by the insurance company, then bought by an aggregator who specialized in such cars, and then sold at auction to the used car dealer my sister bought it from.

She kept it a year. It never ran right. She babied it along to keep it on the road (usually with wipers, ECU, lights, etc either not functioning, or functioning sporadically. I can’t recall the amount of times she was left stranded.

But, it looked good and she got a “hulluva” deal on it.","

However, there are plenty of people out there who don't have such internal brakes and will borrow every dollar that is offered to them by anybody. For those, a stark and somewhat rigid advice of avoiding debt altogether, including personal vehicle, may be the best thing they need. So I would not be so dismissive of it.

This is 335 or 340, depending on the year. Look at the rear quarter panel. 4-series has a different shape of the rear window, which is behind the door, as opposed to 3-series being part of the door. Also, notice the front quarterpanel ""gill"" in the 4-series GC, missing in your picture.

4-series is what used to be coupe/convertible 3-series. 4-series Grand Coupe starts as coupe and then builds up the rear. for the second set of doors and rear hatch. It also has frameless doors, just like the coupe does (you can see it in the center pillar). Sizewise 3 and 4 series they are nearly the same. I think 4-series has slightly wider wheeltrack.

I would imagine that now an ordered VW Passat would not be difficult to procure since the are built in Tennessee. Same thing for many other cars and SUV's that are built in the U.S.A.

Ordering a car for a customer is not what a salesman or sales manager prefers. Firstly, it delays the sale of an automobile - they can't count it as a sale until you leave the dealership with the car. An ordered car usually takes between 5 and 8 weeks to get to the dealership from the assembly point.

As for Lexus and Infiniti, it can take 8-12 weeks to get the car to the dealership from the time it is ordered from the factory. When I was at Infiniti as a manager, it was not difficult to procure a vehicle for a customer that did not want what we had on the lot. We carried an inventory of over 500 new cars. I had the ability to look up on my computer specific cars filtered for color, equipment, availability (in production, on the ocean, awaiting transport, at the port, or at another dealership. Thus, I could dealer-trade for the car the customer wanted, search the ports of entry, search what was in production or scheduled for production, on the ocean, etc. I never ordered a car for a customer - it took much too long to get the precise car or SUV the customer wanted. But all of the time, a customer would settle for one more option, especially if I picked up the cost of that option and threw it into the deal to sweeten it.

I've ordered only one car from Mercedes Benz - the one that came in sans some equipment - then had to have it re-ordered. I would not order a car from the factory again - what I usually desire is either in inventory or available at another dealer.","
I think some of those differences are just ""local flavors"" of the owners or management. However, it's clear that Japanese guys either don't even infrastructure built for car ordering at all (I know Honda simply doesn't take orders, period - not sure if that extends to Acura), or have it greatly reduced (I remember local Toyota dealer made it sound once as possible, just time consuming).

VW dealers are probably most inconsistent throughout all the brands, not just about orders - about anything. From old school greasy slick guys (take a long hot shower after a visit) to modern upscale dealers, pleasant and professional. I think it's because they are almost never stand alone, so their culture is usually driven by those other franchises they are attached to, as those are usually volume drivers. At least that's how it looks in Tampa Bay.","
It's probably not really a function where it's made, more like who is selling. The only difference may be time, as those made in the US should have a shorter lead time vs. those made overseas.","I saw another 2018 Toyota Camry on the road this morning with some really nice factory wheels. I think I mentioned this before that the car is quite nicely designed - with one exception - the front grille work. From the side and the rear, the car is beautiful. But then, when you look at that front end, it destroys the beauty of the car. Would I own a Camry - very possibly. I would want the 6 cylinder version and the leather interior - and all of the safety features I currently have become accustomed to. I have not driven the newly styled Camry and will probably do so prior to my lease ending. I've got plenty of time before that happens - but the styling on the new Camry and the new Avalon is a major departure for Toyota - the mundanely styled Toyotas seem to be a thing of the past - good move for Toyota.","I have to agree, nice looking car until you see the front. The butter-face of automobiles.","What kind of surprises me is that it is difficult to find AWD crossovers in the south and Florida. Most lots seem heavily tilted to FWD making the CUV a tall wagon. You get big rains and north of Florida occasional snow, and Florida has a lot of northerners and Canadians. The price difference isn't all that huge percentage wise. But I guess that's what you mean about markets being local.

I think the new Camry is nice looking, but it is a bit low to the ground with low roofline clearance compared to the previous model. So it probably depends on your personal preferences and how your body works in it.","Mike, if you want to go for a loaded up Camry V6, and the budget is not too compressed, why not just go with the Lexus ES? Get some extra features, nicer dealer experience, and IMO better seats.","
As you know, I have ordered my last two cars. These were Euro delivery orders, but it was just a sweetener, I would most likely have ended up ordering them even without Euro delivery. The reason was my first car was 1. wagon 2. RWD, 3. Manual, 4. Fairly loaded, but not overloaded. Those simply did not exist on any dealer's lot in the US, even if I had relented on the color (I took blue, really didn't want grey, silver, white, or black, but might have taken white or black if really had no choice). So Euro or not, I would not have been able to get anywhere even close to what I wanted. My second 430i GC would have been a little easier, but still - there were several red available throughout the state, but all had beige or white interior. I would have taken saddle brown/cognac (depending on the model year), or black. I was also open to one or two other colors, but those also ran in beige and pearl white. Then there were options - dealers would have either ordered them stripped, or ""silly loaded"", nothing in between. I like to have certain ""minimum"", which is quite rich, but resist those thousands of bucks added for sake of options. BMW's configurations for 2015-17 models didn't help, either. It was only 2018, when they became much more rational in their configuration approach (I learned later that just six months into the model BMW changed it again and made it even better, but too late for me).

It was really frustrating sifting through the inventory at that time, as I felt I was a hostage to the local order manager's taste and gut feel. To anybody's assertion ""they ordered what sold"" I say that you could see huge differences between inventory of the same models at dealerships in the same metro area. One would have almost exclusively run-the-mill lease specials (non-offending colored strippers), another would be exact opposite - everything loaded to the gills and perhaps just a few strippers. This tells me ""what sells"" was mostly in managers' heads and had not that much to do actual market research. It might be based on some previous transaction records, but that can be very self-fulfilling. As much as I understood the previous situation with the wagon, I simply couldn't grasp why everybody thought that if it's red outside, it must be beige inside, or if it has M-Sport package, it must also have bunch of pricey appearance options raising its price by another 3 grand at least, or if it's 435/440, it must have every option checked under the Sun, running up the price by 15-20 grand to mid 60s, like it would have been a terrible insult to the brand to have a 435/440 priced at say 55-58 grand (still not a stripper then, just selective) sitting on the lot, which was something I would have been open to consider at the time.","Mike, I think you mentioned that you might consider a Buick in your next purchase decision. Well, the Buick Regal GS might fit the bill. It is smooth, quiet, has good road manners and powerful.

Isn't ES based on Avalon now? I thought it's quite a bit bigger than Camry. Which is probably better for Mike. He could also get a good lease on it, as those keep value well.

Edit: just checked the specs. ES has same wheelbase as Camry, Avalon has 2 inches longer - so it seems ES is still based on Camry, as it's been in the past, not Avalon.","Prior Avalons were on a Camry platform, right?

There is a difference. Avalon is a made from modified Camry platform (stretched). In early years, ES used to be a rebadged and reworked Camry (almost ""the same car"", just better made overall, e.g. more welds). Over time, the differences became bigger and bigger. However, seems like the wheelbase, most important dimension for platform, is still identical between ES and Camry, even if other dimensions diverged a bit.",You missed one - 1890: @abacomike & @ab348 born.,"

I admit to being pretty much a GM fanboy but I was unpleasantly surprised by the new Regal. Unattractive to my eye and the interior looked rather cheap. Big disappointment.","
We have that here with our local domestic-model dealers. You cannot find a car in their inventory without a black interior unless it is a model that does not offer black (there used to be a couple of those, not sure now). They use the ""that's what sells"" argument and I think it is BS. I think about half the Mustangs the Ford dealers have in stock are black over black. Really unfortunate.

I think BMW takes longer...at least on some models. There are subtle differences on a 2018 535 compared to my 2012, but to most people it looks the same....even the inside seems pretty much the same.

They are made in Chattanooga........and they do look like a more expensive car when you see them on the road.
Though it is built in America it has German engineering - that is noticeable, but, it is FWD.","enormous interior. long wheelbase, and square design = much room. Definitely a German feel compared to the the competition. A little long in the tooth now, but good feature content and with the 4, good MPG.","
They no longer use the ""gutless 5 cyl"" engine. You have a choice of turbo 4 or normally aspirated V6.

The turbo 4 is adequate, but not nearly as good as the 2.0T engine you used to get in the Passat, and still get in the Audi. I would go for the V6.

I owned a 2008 Passat with the good 2.0T engine (my wife's car mostly). We went to 105k on that car with no major problems, and it was QUICK. Last year, I purchased a 2017 Passat R-Line, and only kept it about 6 months. Basically, I wanted back in a truck, and the 1.8T engine (upgraded this year to 2.0) is adequate, but not any fun. I haven't driven a Passat with the V6, but I expect I would enjoy it.

But ... the Passat is just not in the same class as the cars you are used to, high end BMW's and Mercedes. You would notice the difference, and be unhappy. If you're wanting to save money, and not be (too) unhappy with the step-down, I would think about a 2 year old CPO Genesis, Probably cost you less than $30k, very nice, luxurious, very quick.

You are correct about roommates.  The college matches roomies with each other using a 4-page biographic/personality assessment that all live-on-campus students are required to submit to student housing.  In my grandson’s case, his roomie is a sophomore who is a PO (pitcher only) on the baseball team.  Both of them have similar study approaches and are 1-year apart in age.  His roomie is responsible for my grandson’s adapting to on-campus living and to “show him the ropes” so to speak.

The dorm he is in is fairly new.  Sleeping areas are separate from study areas and they share a bathroom with a stall shower in their room.

Tuition, room/board, fees, etc., runs $45,000+ this year.  Not cheap, but not prohibitive either.  ","Both my kids liked their first roommates, but found their real best friends somewhere down the hall. Me too, come to think of it. Four page questionnaires get you only so far.

I recall I was an older student serving as a mentor after my sophomore year. I think that works well for both.
In fact, our high school band did that for the incoming freshmen to help them make the big jump to the high school.

My son at OSU was lucky because the university botched up his Honors early application number dorm assignment and put him in another tower with 7 other engineering students in the 8-man apartment unit. Son and his eventual roommate both were placed into a sophomore group of 6 others in the Honors dorm. The older guys also checked in early and walked the two new guys around the area before classes started, doing things to make them part of their group. They walked a mile or so downtown to a Mexican restaurant that is authentic run by Mexicans. Kept them busy. Both my son and his roommate checked in early before move-in day! Those six guys deserve a lot of credit for my son's success.

Can anyone believe the university with the fastest supercomputer in Ohio botched up dorm assignments!

The lists are long and varied.  Porsche produced 3-4 sports cars for years - now they offer sedans and SUV’s in addition to their 2-door coupes and convertibles.

BMW produced the 3, 5, 6 and 7 series vehicles and a roadster.  Now they offer a 2, 4, and a new 8 series along with a multitude of SUV’s and an i series (i3 and i8).

Mercedes used to produce a limited number of vehicles in the C (190 E) E (280 E, 300 E & D) S and the Gull Wing.  Now, they offer a myriad of SUV’s, coupes, convertibles, and sports cars.

Audi did the same by offering the A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A3, and sports cars.

Yes, they decided that upscale customer enjoys customization to their taste. I like it to a certain degree, as my own taste is always ""off mainstream"". That's why I have hard time to find anything to really like in Lexus, Infiniti, or Acura stable. They make fine vehicles, I may even like how they drive or prefer their engineering and reliability, but they just don't make them way I'd enjoy. Want red color? Only with beige upholstery. Want a hatchback? What's ahashbak? You can really see a difference between attitudes of their salespeople. You mention an order in those Japanese Big Lux Three and they run screaming from you or give you this blank stare. This is especially true at Acura, which generally sells its cars fully loaded with very few additional options, kind of ""antiBenz"" in that regard. Lexus and Infiniti bundle them into huge packages, but their color combinations are still quite limited in comparison with BMW or Benz. You ask for a special order at Benz, Audi, or BMW dealerships, you get a smile and no problem (at least those I visited). In fact, BMW has some special colors for both exterior and interior (inlays) on many of their models that are available by order only (dealers sometimes use fake names on those orders to get them into showrooms). I remember people at BMW factory boast that ""every car is sold before it's put into production"". It's BS, of course, as they mean dealers commit to an order on their own behalf (within allotments), but it's booked like an ""ordered"" car. You pay of course, for that ""feeling special"", whatever that means to you, but it's available if you want it. At Lexus you get a nice customer lounge, pampered treatment and all, but the car itself is just about (or literally) the same as 10 thousand other cars sold this month.","Arteon has indeed replaced the CC.

QUESTION

I purchased a set of wiper blades at a local Canadian Tire store and on the way home, after getting gas at a local gas station, I asked the attendant if he would put the wiper blades on the car for me. He told me that he would and I gave him a two-dollar tip for doing so. The next day or two, I had to use the wipers and the wiper blade on the passenger’s side came off. I was still in the driveway so I immediately shut the wipers off. The next day, I went back to the gas station to ask why he had not put the wipers on properly. The kid was very rude and the owner of the garage told me to leave the lot. This email is to alert motorists that they should be very careful of asking anyone at gas stations to do any type of small jobs that require a brain.

ANSWER

To save you from any type of embarrassment, I have left your name out of this column. You have said your peace but you and I know that you have been far from honest as to what happened with your car’s wiper blades. The young man at the gas station told you that the wiper blades that you’d purchased were the wrong ones and that they were too big for your car. You told him that you wanted to have as much of the window cleaned as you possibly could so he did install them for you. When you went back to the gas station, which is also a garage, you called the lad an imbecile and went on to tell him that you wanted the two dollar tip back and that he should go back to school or he would be pumping gas for the rest of his life. The owner of the garage told you that that kind of talk was unnecessary and he asked one of the technicians to again install the wiper blade for you. In doing so, the wiper blade came back off when the technician told you to put the wipers on. The technician then told you that the wiper blades were too big and hitting one another and that they were not the proper wiper blades for your vehicle. He then offered to sell you the proper wiper blades and that is when you also went ballistic on him. That is also when the owner of the station suggested that you take your business somewhere else. That is the last that they heard from you until I contacted them. So what have we learned? I have learned that a young college person, working the summer at a gas station, should not have been scolded by a woman who was entirely at fault and who should have taken the advice from this young man when he told her that the wiper blades, that she had just purchased, were not the correct ones","

Retirement benefits for educators is not what it used to be.  Many States have reduced benefits for recent hires (last 10 years).

It also depends on the State in which you taught.  I receive 1/2 the amount from Illinois that a friend of mine receives from New York.  He gets over $110,000 a year in pension benefits + health insurance.  Many midwestern and plains States are quite low.  Here in Florida, pensions are abysmal.","There are a couple of NYS teachers in my family. The sometimes get talking about pension tiers. The younger one (58 vs. 43) complains about her plan being lower (though I think she just snuck in before the benefits were reduced). The older one retires as soon as she has he 58th birthday because that maxes her out. Not sure exactly what the % is, but I think at least 75% with full medical. And teaching in a suburban LI district (the wealthy part of the island), she is not underpaid. I would love that deal! Maybe not enough to put up with a classroom full of HS freshman though.","I know it isn't easy, but at a little over 180 days per school year (basically 6 months) with summers off and the pension (not as great as it used to be, but still...). Do it for 20 years or 25 years and get out.","NYPD was great for that. My best friends father was a city cop. joined at like 22 after getting out of the army. retired at 42 with a 75% pension and medical benefits. then he went to work for the NY national guard (as a civilian) which I believe was in the state pension pool. Worked another 20, retired again at 62 with a large pension. between the 2 pensions he was making much more than he ever did working, plus lifetime medical coverage.","
That’s exactly what I did.  I put 25 years into education (teaching and administration) and in my second life I was in private school administration and car sales and management.  When I couple my pension (3% increase every January 1st) and my social security, I live nicely.  No complaints at all.  But if I got a NY State pension, it would be sweet!

I always taught 12 months a year and my administrative contracts were 12 months, so I never got summers off.  Taught summer school every year to make ends meet.","
Yep - one of my best friends down here retired at 54 years old as a NYC detective.  Retirement pension is two times greater than my pension and he and his wife have full medical coverage.","stickguy said:

Illinois has pension ties based on when you started. It basically affects when you get vestedcand when you can retire. Currently I am 30 months from my earliest retirement date but will likely go way beyond that date.","And he probably complained about taxes
","
None of the teachers in the small Midwest schools where I lived got summers off. They all worked summer jobs to make ends meet. They also bought most of the school supplies they needed out of their own pocket. We will have a very hard time attracting the best and brightest teachers of the future if we as a society don’t value them and pay them well.","

You bet!  But I can’t do that any more - that’s why I am leasing - keeps me from buying cars every year or so.","As far as I'm concerned, professions like public school teachers, policemen, and firefighters deserve every penny of the pensions they get. I think they are woefully underpaid. Those are thankless jobs that not many of us would do, and they have gotten more difficult over the past 10 years or so. The lack of respect for these people by parents (for teachers) and the general public (for police and fire fighters) is just horrible. We should be thankful that people are willing to still do these jobs.","What about the pension offset for those retirees receiving both social security and a public pension simultaneously.

The way I understand it is that your social security benefits are reduced (offset) by your your public pension benefits by a certain amount that basically prevents double dipping. Not sure if that provision applies to all public pension plans though as in Massachusetts. ","I believe there are a lot of offset rules baked into SS. Also for earned income. It makes sense since people in the public sector did not pay SS on those wages.

Bean, I don't think you can make that blanket statement about teachers. It really depends where you are. In most NE states, if you are teaching in a suburban district, the pay is quite good with excellent benefits (on top of the pension). and of course, lots of days off. Different story in some other parts of the country, or in many inner cities. But, that is the same for most jobs.

and of course, if it is a job that is so thankless that you don't want to do it, you should find a different profession.","Most teachers I know love their jobs but have a hard time living on the low salary. Even in the Northeast, the pay may be higher than for teachers elsewhere, but so is the cost of living.","bwia said:

I have both because I always had a part time job or worked weekends when I taught.  Couldn’t live on a Teacher’s salary.  They did not take out social security on my teacher’s Salary - I paid in 8.5% of my own money to the State teacher retirement system.  But because I had 33 full years of quarters for social security wages, my social security was not reduced by the offset.  Also, my last 10 years of social security wages were my highest salaried employment which raised my benefits from $950 a month to $1400+ a month.  I was lucky to have had sufficient years of social security covered employment.

Most teachers in Illinois are not covered by social security.  But I did have to pay into Medicare - thank goodness - so I was covered.","

He’s not at Nebraska - he’s at Doane University in Crete, NE, about 20 miles south of Lincoln.  It’s a small school with a $102 million endowment.  It was established in the mid 1800’s.  Several Major League Baseball players came out of that school.

If he had gone to a division I or II school instead of a division III school, he’d sit on the bench for 2 years.  He wants to play baseball - not sit on the bench.  This way, he is a starting pitcher and will play 1st base - they also want him in the batting order because he hits well - had 8 home runs in his senior year in high school.  And....this way he gets a 65% scholarship (tuition/room/board) instead of a 50% scholarship at the University of CA San Bernardino, Los Angeles or Santa Barbara.

Add the $8500 scholastic scholarship to that 65% sports scholarship, he goes to college at almost a full scholarship.","bwia said:

I am sure it is a nice smooth comfortable car if one likes that above all else, it will probably be reliable, and as Toyota has taught us, looks don't matter.

I suspect there will be sweetheart leases and maybe fleet sales - prior Azera (and Genesis) were once quite common in fleets, and while Genesis seems to have moved out of that realm, the mainstream models are still heavily entrenched.
","The styling is just so derivative. Regarding the real thing, a heavily warrantied CPO/lease return is often indistinguishable from a new one to non-enthusiasts, and can be had for the price of a mainstream or non-prestige model.

For many models, the talk of out of warranty issues is exaggerated.

Not to mention that 80% or more of the time that I have 4 wheels under me it's not fun driving regardless of what car it is and over 80% of the time I can really get going on the road I have two wheels under me.

Our town is notorious for requiring permits. We had some company give us an estimate for finishing the basement and they told us our town is only one of two where they would actually get permits before starting any work. 

One of my neighbors finished their basement themselves without getting any permits. When they went to sell the house they tried to get the transfer stamps for the sale the town saw ""finished basement"" on the paperwork and reviewed all the permits for the house and couldn't find one for the basement. So the town refused to allow the sale until a permit was issued and the basement inspected. 


It is very interesting what we found out. We had a plot plan that was drawn up by an architect for the previous owner 8 years ago before we bought the house. He had to have a new septic system put in. When my contractor presented the 2010 plot plan to the city, they rejected it and said we had to have new plans drawn up. Their reasoning was that the 2010 drawings didn't include a review area (the 25' from the wetlands where nothing can be built). The city also rejected the 2010 drawing because it didn't include a soil test. ""How can this be?"" my contractor asked. ""These plans were approved by the city in order for the septic system to be installed."" The woman my contractor was dealing with looks up the previous owner and says, ""oh. I see. He has a close family member on the board. That's how this slipped through.""

SO for those of you who are curious, we are going with pressure treated wood frame and deck flooring. The railings and spindles will be plastic (azec is the material I believe). I'll make sure to take before & after pics. Current deck is 8' off the house and 15' wide (including the stairs). New (approved) deck will be 15' off the house and 25' long (plus the stairs).","
Chick-fil-a and Popeyes both built new buildings here about two years ago. They both announced it about the same time. Chick-fil-a was located outside the city limits while Popeyes was in the city (business area, but still within the city limits). Chick-fil-a was open and operating almost a year before Popeyes.","

No idea. They seemed a regular thing at the place we were eating within the ""colony"". Our server told us as she was bringing another round that the chef had cooked up a batch of fresh spearmint syrup that morning to use in making them and the smell while that was underway was wonderful.

Our hydrants have been yellow with blue hats for quite some time. Feels like the result of a study on visibility","Well, have to rely on the internet again, so I take no responsibility;
National Fire Protection Agency, commonly known as the NFPA set up NFPA code 291. This code gives guidelines pertaining to fire hydrants. The guidelines recommended are as follows, below 500GPM should be painted red, 500-999 GPM should be painted orange, 1000-1499 GPM should be painted green, and 1500 GPM or more should be painted blue. The guidelines primarily talk about the top of the hydrants and suggest painting the bottom of the hydrants yellow.

Hydrant Class

(GPM) Gallons Per Minute
Class AA
Blue
1500 or more
Class A
Green
1000-1499
Class B
Orange
500-999
Class C
Red
Less than 500

I think Yellow is recommended, but some places still use red.
And, If the hydrant is not hooked to a public water system, but instead is accessing a private system (as in the case of a shared well by several houses in a specific neighborhood) the hydrant should be painted a color distinguishing it from a publicly supplied system. NFPA recommends red","I have a hydrant right in front of my house (you'd think that would give a bit of a reduction on home insurance, but noooooo) and it is red, like all the other hydrants here in town. So I guess they do not follow the NFPA code.

I remember when I was a kid most of the hydrants here were yellow. I recall when visiting the USA seeing ones that were painted red, white and blue that looked quite patriotic.","Speaking of water, my Moen kitchen faucet developed an annoying drip a few weeks ago. I remembered that Moen touts a lifetime warranty so I dug out some old paperwork and amazingly found the documents that came with it along with the sales slip from 2002. I called Moen, they were very helpful, and sent out a repair kit for it. I decided to try to install it today.

Taking it apart was easy enough. That was about all the instructions that came with the parts were good for. The lady I spoke to at Moen when getting the parts sent said that she would email me a better set of instructions, which she did, and they were much better but still not 100% clear on a few points. Thankfully there are many YouTube videos on the topic and a couple of them were the most useful. Eventually after a couple of puzzlers I got it all back together and was happy that it seemed to work well with no leaks.

About an hour or so later I went to use the faucet and discovered that the cold side was now hot and vice versa. Nowhere in any of the things I read or watched did this get mentioned and there was nothing marked on the new cartridge to indicate what was what. Another web search revealed it is a common issue and thankfully an easy 5-minute fix. God forbid that any of the instructions mention that fact though!",Well be grateful you didn't do that to your toilet.,"The State of Florida is under a “state of emergency” due to the ever-increasing expansion of something they call “red algae”!

Last year, it was prevalent on the east coast in Palm Beach County.  It is caused by the Water Management District releasing millions of gallons of water from Lake Okeechobee to rivers that empty into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.  Many blame the sugarcane industry because this algae is nourished by fertilizer used to grow the sugarcane.  When it rains heavily, like it does during our rainy season (July through October), run-off water from soil rich in nitrates - especially sugarcane farms - flows in streams and tributaries into Lake Okeechobee.  When the water level reaches its maximum in the lake, it must be lowered so as not to flood the Everglades and other adjacent acreage.

Right now, it is heaviest in the Tampa-St. Pete area and south to Sarasota.  The algae is red/peach in color and gives off a horrible stench.  It also kills aquatic life.  Millions of pounds of fish have washed up on the beaches on the west coast.

It seems that this red algae does something to the food fish eat and oxygenation of the water.  I have never seen it firsthand down here but it is causing havoc on the west coast.",https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/a22735503/a-used-bmw-i8-is-the-supercar-for-everyone/,"

I have to leave a full 25’ between the wetlands.  This is called the “review area.”  So the new deck that was proposed was 16’ x 24’.  At those dimensions, the right corner of the deck was going to be sitting at 25’ 4” from the wetlands.  So instead of arguing over 4”, my contractor came up with the idea to make the deck 15’ x 25’ and moving it to the left so the “review area” will be completely clear.

He said, this is why people have work done without permits.  The city breaks chops just to break chops and make people spend money.

The second bidder gave us one price, slightly higher overall, but, they didn't insult us by even making stainless steel screws an option.

I'm gonna purchase it and watch the Seahawk's 2nd nfl exhibition game this weekend. If it goes well, I've got the problem solved with not having DirecTV's Sunday Ticket (around $450 for the season). I've got a HP 22"" monitor on my HP Desktop, what's the problem here?

ab348 and anyone else who might be curious - I went in and tried to sign up for this knowing it sounds too good ta be true - turns out they have you give yourself a u/n and p/w because it's a program that streams NFL and NCAA college football games on the net for you. A couple things I've learned about it: 1) The streams come to you once the game is over and they cut out all of the commercials. They have ""contracts"" with over 600 TV channels supposedly. I'm still interested at this point - I could actually dig watching my Seahawk games this way. I would just have ta be careful that I don't accidentally catch the final score before I watch the stream - that wouldn't kill the buzz completely but it would knock it down a big notch.


2) It wouldn't take my credit card information. I wrote a message to their management and they said nothing about that, just that they'd take payment by PayPal, too. I've used PayPal before and found it to be useful and it worked well. There's been no suspicious activity on our credit card since I tried using it on their website and it didn't work. So that's good.

So, punt the whole idea away...or try signing up with PayPal. It is cheap, and, it would be an acceptable way to watch my favorite NFL team play their games. And our new running back, Rashaad Penny, broke a finger already and is out for 4-5 games.

Life in the USA about 100 years ago: *The average life expectancy for men was 47 years.* *Fuel for cars was sold in drug stores only.* *Only 14 percent of the homes had a bathtub.* *Only 8 percent of the homes had a telephone.* *There were only 8,000 cars and only 144 miles of paved roads.* *The maximum speed limit in most cities was 10 mph.* I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPY *The average US wage in 1910 was 22 cents per hour.* *The average US worker made between $200 and $400 per year.* *A competent accountant could expect to earn $2000 per year,* *A dentist $2,500 per year, a veterinarian between $1,500 and $4,000 peryear.* *More than 95 percent of all births took place at HOME.* *Ninety percent of all Doctors** had NO COLLEGE EDUCATION!* *Instead, they attended so-called medical schools,* *Many of which were condemned in the press AND the government assubstandard.'* *Sugar cost four cents a pound.* *Eggs were fourteen cents a dozen.* *Coffee was fifteen cents a pound.* *The five leading causes of death were:* *1. Pneumonia and influenza* *2, Tuberculosis* *3. Diarrhea* *4. Heart disease* *5. Stroke* *The population of Las Vegas Nevada was only 30!* *Crossword puzzles, canned beer, and iced tea hadn't been invented yet* *Two out of every 10 adults couldn't read or write and only 6 percent of all Americans had graduated from high school. *There were about 230 reported murders in the ENTIRE U.S.A. !*
I really have to question these figures. Ford produced over 14,000 model Ts in 1909 so there had to be more than 8,000 cars on the road. 

in 1910 the homicide rate was 4.6 per 100,000 so 230 murders would equate to a population of 5 million. However the population was over 92 million then which would mean well over 4 thousand murders
.
OK, so 2 wrong out of 20! What am I, a walking encyclopedia? Just read - don't question, takes all the fun out of it
Well 2 that I knew of off hand, would need to research others. It's just when even two are so blatantly wrong it calls into question the rest.

@abacomike I'm glad you had a wonderful visit with your son & grandson for the past few days!
Thanks, Bradd.  Yes it was short (3 nights) but I will take what I can get.

My grandson exhibits definite behaviors that indicate “self-awareness” but lacks certain skills in the awareness of others.  He basically is after self-satisfaction (eats only what he wants - doesn’t want to try different foods) and does not pick up on non-verbal cues in the facial expressions of those he comes in contact with.

At times he’ll burst out verbally when something attracts his attention - like a plane taking off - but does not understand that the outburst is very distracting to other individuals in the car.  My son is very in tune with him and corrects his behaviors in a strong, fatherly approach.  

He is high functioning.  He spent most of his time playing online games with headphones.  He was well-behaved at the movies and at the restaurants. He is adorable but does not like to be touched.  He did come over and hug me when I dropped him off at the airport when I opened my arms to say goodbye but resisted my kiss to his forehead.  

Like me I said, I take what I can get.","Toronto as a center for technology.
Good summary of some reasons why
Some reasons, *Major universities and colleges, very livable city, more affordable than other major cities, much lower salaries, diversity from immigrants.","We were hoping to have our current deck taken down and having a bigger one put up this summer. Currently the deck is 8' off the back of the house and about 12' wide (15' if you count the stairs). There's barely enough room for a small round table with 4 chairs (we are a family of 5) and my grill. This past winter, one side of the stairs separated themselves from the deck.

We met with a few contractors, picked the one we liked based on the recommendation of friends who used him last year (theirs came out beautiful), agreed on a price, & took out a HELOC to pay for it. My property has protected wetlands behind it and on the side (there is a creek in my back yard). I wanted to have this done properly. I paid the contractor to have plans drawn up & permits pulled. There was a survey done on my property back in 2010 before I moved in (the previous owner had to pay to have a new septic system installed for us). According to the city, that survey is no longer good. They want a new survey. Survey, Architectural Drawings, Permit Fees all add up to about $4K.

The new deck I proposed was going to sit 18' off the house (as opposed to 8') and 22' wide (as opposed to 12'). The city looked at the plans and said that at 18' was going to be too close to the variance of where they want me to stay away from the wetlands (so If they want nothing within 25' of the wetlands, they don't want my structure on top of that ""line""). My contractor submitted new plans to have the deck 2' shorter (16') and 2' wider (24'), so this way the end of the deck will be far off the ""line"" and the concrete footings will be 4' from the ""line"" instead of 2'.

I got an email from the contractor this AM saying: ""I was thinking we should get together and talk about the deck so we are on the same page."" This can't be good. If I just wasted $4K on plans, permits, & a survey for him to tell me that the city won't let me build anything close to the size I want I AM NOT going to be happy.","$4K for plans, permits, surveys?! I think we spent around $500 on a survey several years ago that was still good for our deck project and permits within the borough we live aren't more than a few hundred dollars. In fact our contractor suggested we may even be able to get away with no permits since we were technically leaving the piers in place for the upper deck and it was merely a replacement and we are friendly with all the neighbors, we didn't want to chance it so we directed him to get the applicable permits and include in the quote.","That sucks. Backing to open space is nice, but our next house won’t have water or easements behind it. We have a draining easement (for a ditch) and when we fenced the yard, I had to move it in about 10’ to not block that. So a piece of my land is useless now.

But at least I don’t have a house behind me. Just woods beyond the fence.","And, Toronto is quite near the home of my 3rd favorite rock band ever, The Tragically Hip.

RIP Gordon Downie","I also live on the edge of a wetlands. You may not be able to build out as far as you wanted because of the water table, and also because you may be encroaching on habitat.

It is frustrating but try to take the long view.","That, and less deck to maintain!",Local talent begins with good high schools. I'm surprised the article/s did not mention that as a major contributing factor.,"
Due to the wetlands and the creek, my water tables are extremely high. I have a 1/2 hp sump pump that spits water out multiple times per day.","
Funny, the lessons I learned from the recent incident indicate to avoid backing up when possible, but when you have to, do so with above average speed, acceleration, and authority (burn rubber with 2WD). The less seconds you are in reverse, the less chance someone coming out of ""nowhere"" to hit you while you'll be at fault.

Cities don't care about wasting money. Government seems to think money grows on trees.

On my current project at work, the City decided they didn't like the reviewed and approved permitted drawings for the traffic signal intersection improvements we were doing as part of the new building upgrades ""deal"" with the City.

They said, yes, it was approved, permitted, but we didn't really look at those slopes, they don't meet our current ADA guidelines. We had already re-poured curb, gutter, and sidewalk. The owner is going to pay for this.

So far, no one from the City has offered to compensate anyone for the delays, demo of newly poured concrete, rework, and errors on their part. I suppose they could ultimately point the finger at the Civil Engineer for doing it wrong in the first place. However, there is no feasible solution. The final conclusion after forcing 3 revised sets of drawings that all don't work is to ""return to existing and match the existing asphalt grades and slopes.""

What's with the individual sign? Are y'all in a shared space and edmunds is like renting a few desks?","I was driving back to my Condo using the main road inside our complex. I stopped at the stop sign a few hundred feet from the entrance to my Condo Village when I noticed a woman driving a black Chrysler 300 sedan pass the stop sign opposite me and made a turn doing at least 25 miles per hour and began to speed up once she completed the turn in front of me. I make my right turn and saw that car jump the right curb and crashed its right front end into a Royal Palm Tree and it flipped over onto its left side trapping the driver inside the car. I stopped about 100 feet behind the car and immediately called 911.

I walked quickly over to the car and saw that the woman was jammed against the driver's door and I had no way of getting her out because the car was on its left side. I told her to be calm and that I had called the 911 emergency line and the police, fire and ambulance were on their way. There was nothing else I could do.

I got back into my car and drove over to my parking space and then walked back to the car that h ad flipped onto its left side. I have n ever seen anything like that - a car flipped onto its left side against the curb of the street. When the fire department arrived about 4 minutes later, then go on top of the right side of the car, opened the door, and go the woman out of the car through the right passenger door. She seemed OK but the EMT's decided to take her to the emergency room anyway.

I don't know what was wrong with the driver, but my guess is that she either was intoxicated, over-medicated or reacting to a medication, on her cell phone talking or texting, or some mechanical problem with the car. She obviously lost control of the car after her fast turn and high speed.

Unfortunately, I did not take a photo of the car when it was on its left side, but I did just take a photo(s) of the car being hauled off by a tow truck.

The driver was not a resident - she was a care worker because of her uniform and was in her 30's - at least that's what I saw.

I may have told this story before. My sister was a rural route carrier for the Post Office in Colorado. One of the places she delivered mail to had this dog that would run up to her car, clamp down on the back bumper of her car and wouldn't let go. She had to slowly drive away dragging the dog until it let go. 

There was a theory offered by zoologists that a car's hubcaps or spinners or wire wheels, glinting in the sun, reminds the dog of their ancient pack-hunting ways, as they became transfixed on the hoofs of their prey.

Well, not to harp on speed, but I think a crash assessment would clearly show excessive speed on the part of the other vehicle if that driver was going too fast for a parking lot. A collision of that magnitude in a parking lot surely indicates that at least one party was moving waaaaay too fast.","
That's a bit scary! How many did you hit prior to having that system?!

I think that if I had a system like that, it would only serve to anger me. If I hit something, it is often because I intend to hit it. For example, if my car stopped itself because a dog ran out in front of me, I would be quite annoyed. I would much rather hit a dog at 5mph than have my car stop me. The dog learns nothing good from the car stopping.

My neighbors used to have a dog that liked to chase cars. After I hit it once at low speed (all the neighbors would stop instead, and then complain about the dog chasing cars), it never chased another car... and the neighbors were able to keep their dog. A much better alternative than the inevitable dogcake.","I should rephrase.

Yes, the fact she didn't stop till at least 2 car length past me tends to indicate that, in addition to the damage she did to her car which fared far worse than mine. I know the Civic doesn't have 6-piston Brembos, but it's also a pretty light car that can brake fast.

The problem with blaming speed though is that all she had to do was hit the brakes, or the gas, or swerve a bit more to avoid me! Who knows, maybe she did swerve a bit and in an epic error of judgment didn't swerve hard enough to make tire noises and/or avoid me. Or maybe she sped up thinking she'd get by me and the Civic's little motor failed her.

If she was going 40 then maybe excessive speed had a role. I think speed was a factor for her, even at 20, as she obviously wasn't paying attention. You certainly shouldn't drive fast if your going to text and drive. You shouldn't even drive slow and text and drive though.

Given the narrow travel lanes between parking lot spots, I'd say she was going too fast for her.","Thank you xwesx--we all need to remember basic civility, even in the thick of the storm.","xwesx said:

At ten miles per hour, it takes approximately 27 feet from the time a driver sees an obstacle until they can completely stop the car. Ten is the max reasonable parking lot speed. Faster than that is excessive. At 20 mph, the distance increases to 63 feet. So, not only was the driver not seeing and reacting to a clear threat (e.g., if you were going ""1 mph"" as you backed, it took a long time for you to reach the position of impact), but also clearly going faster than anything that could be considered a reasonable speed.","

Yes, it is a choice we all make. Most herding dogs do pretty well with the car chasing thing. It's the dumb ones that run out in front of the cars to ""chase"" them that generally end up in the doggie morgue. This was one of those, but it didn't end up there thanks to my efforts. And, really, that's my point: A program and sensors cannot read situations to determine the best course of action; all they can do is make the same response to a given set of input parameters.","

No injuries to either party, but the Lincoln driver said the car had issues after the crash, maybe frame-related as the alignment was always off after that, and they soon replaced it with a 1965 Cadillac.

By the description of the damage to her vehicle she had to be behind you or just almost so when you started backing out. Otherwise how would you have damaged her car doors.

Most articles on the subject say backing into a space is much safer than trying to back out of a parking space.

Here is a summary.
“Needless to say, back-in parking takes more time and effort than head-in parking. Yet, it is easier, quicker, and safer when exiting. Thus we may conjecture that people take the trouble to back in demonstrate the ability to delay gratification; they want to invest more time and effort now so they can enjoy the fruits of their labor later. They demonstrate a culture of long-term orientation.”

It certainly appears that way, but the problem is I hadn't ""just started backing out."" I was backing out for quite some time already before colliding with her. She was no where near me when I started backing out. Want to do the math on how many feet of distance you cover at 20 MPH (admittedly a guess at her speed) over let's say, 5 seconds? She came from very far away to hit me the way she did. She was not in the proper right lane. I don't think she tried to swerve to avoid me which only leaves two possibilities:

1) She sought out to hit me as I was backing out, and aimed for just behind me.

2) She was in the middle or center left of the two narrow lanes in the parking lot, and not in her proper travel lane. If she was driving on the proper side of the travel lane of the parking lot, she would have hit my doors, instead of vice versa.

3) She was most definitely carrying some speed, I'm pretty sure my guessitimate of 20 is good +/- 5 MPH. At 1 MPH, no one that is parked should be able to hit the front half of the side of your vehicle. That tends to show the coast was not clear IMO. If your back half is hit, that favors the woman. I think insurance companies just look at who was moving and who reached the point of impact first. Since she was going 15 to 20X faster than me, she got there first, but I most definitely had to ""pull back in"" after getting out of my car, because it was in the way, precisely as I've remembered and described the events.

Unfortunately for me, there were several people nearby, but they did not see what happened, they only looked after hearing the sound of a collision, but they were in the parking lot very close by, too bad!

I sort of see the logic, just a small benefit I think. Even so, I think I will start doing it, at least a majority of the time.

The problem is in my recent example, the parking lot for the restaurant was shaped sort of like the letter ""P""
I was facing where the loop meets the center of the straight line. I was backing out in a straight line, because the travel lane from the looping portion of the P was behind me, so I could back out for several car lengths if I had wanted to. The coast behind me was indeed clear, I wasn't backing out into the unknown, but I'll have to really watch my sides for much longer now. I won't assume other drivers are idiots, I'll assume I'm invisible I guess.

No question about it - front and rear cross traffic alert systems are great.  Coupled with those features, my car stops/brakes if it senses an imminent collision with front or rear cross traffic.  Same for pedestrians - it alerts and automatically stops the car if there is an imminent collision sensed.

The problem is if she didnt swerve then you hit her as you were backing out plain and simple, otherwise her damage would have been on her front end. Seeing that your contact with that other car is at the front door tells me that you backed into her as she was passing you. 

Now at 1 MPH you would be traveling at about a foot and a half or so a second. this means you would travel between at least 2 to 3 feet into her path before she could have even touched the brakes. Add that to the stopping distance it is easy to see that you may have not seen her when you started to back up.

She was backing out slowly and he turned into her from the parallel drive so that her right rear bumper and his right rear door met.

2) She was in the middle or center left of the two narrow lanes in the parking lot, and not in her proper travel lane. If she was driving on the proper side of the travel lane of the parking lot, she would have hit my doors, instead of vice versa.

3) She was most definitely carrying some speed, I'm pretty sure my guessitimate of 20 is good +/- 5 MPH. At 1 MPH, no one that is parked should be able to hit the front half of the side of your vehicle. That tends to show the coast was not clear IMO. If your back half is hit, that favors the woman. I think insurance companies just look at who was moving and who reached the point of impact first. Since she was going 15 to 20X faster than me, she got there first, but I most definitely had to ""pull back in"" after getting out of my car, because it was in the way, precisely as I've remembered and described the events.

Unfortunately for me, there were several people nearby, but they did not see what happened, they only looked after hearing the sound of a collision, but they were in the parking lot very close by, too bad! I definitely asked them if they saw what she did because an eye witness would have been helpful.

The problem is if she didnt swerve then you hit her as you were backing out plain and simple, otherwise her damage would have been on her front end. Seeing that your contact with that other car is at the front door tells me that you backed into her as she was passing you. 

Now at 1 MPH you would be traveling at about a foot and a half or so a second. this means you would travel between at least 2 to 3 feet into her path before she could have even touched the brakes. Add that to the stopping distance it is easy to see that you may have not seen her when you started to back up.

I would really like to hear her side of the story. But by your description of the damage there is not much I can come up with. 


She managed to sneak her front end behind me ""just in time"" for me to back into her. Hence the damage to my right corner despite backing out straight. This is the essence of your argument and what I think ultimately won her case for her, the fact is I was still moving rearward when she got behind me.

Saying she's a terrible driver for allowing her car to be hit by a car moving 1 MPH for over 5 seconds at a constant speed and direction, is a true statement, but it doesn't change fault in the eyes of insurance company.

She was equally as bad or as good as a completely blind driver, and just happened to have gotten lucky with her position and timing. I was easily about 10' into the path of travel before I was hit, but since I was still moving, you can technically say we hit each other, and she had the right of way.

At the point where I was hit I was so far back I actually was well past the point of ""letting my guard down"" regarding side impacts, and was merely looking directly behind me. Anyone with 2 working eyeballs that was actually actively using them would not have impacted my vehicle, of that I'm 100% certain.",,"





I am not attempting to describe “at fault” blame in my several posts.  My car stops - period!  If you had my cross traffic/pedestrian system on your car, you would not have hit that woman’s car.  She might have hit you - but you wouldn’t have hit her - like you did.

Just accept the fact that you backed into her while she was driving legally.  

Let me fix your statement so that it makes sense:

""Just accept the fact that you backed into her while she was driving with right of way precedence legally.

Now I get why old fuddy duddies don't like fast drivers. You're afraid you could get blamed when someone going 100 hits you doing 10 MPH, or in my case, approximately 20 MPH vs. my 1-2 MPH.

Simple physics should make it easy for a car moving 10 to 20X faster to avoid one moving 10 to 20 times slower!

Particularly at parking lot speeds, how long should one reasonably take to react to a backing out vehicle? Seems like a sure-fire way to inspire insurance fraud. If I wanted to commit insurance fraud, now I know how. Just target a vehicle backing out of a parking space, and make sure you fly by with just inches to spare to make it seem like they backed into you!",I am a complete IDIOT.

Consider it a lesson learned. There is a saying ""Don't feed the troll"".","I just think the rule of thumb for parking lots should be changed to:

1. Front half of the side of your car gets backed into (forward moving car's fault assuming both are moving).

2. Back half of the side of your car gets backed into (backing up car's fault assuming both are moving).

Of course, most of the time when you back out you are turning; this was a rare case.

I am not going to say too much yet though....I still have to get on using my laptop when I go to Florida.","If you have your laptop in CA with you, can you try to get on there?",,"Good one, bwia!","Well, I'm sad to report the Alltrack has been violated. This one, as I figured, knowing insurance companies, was pinned on me, despite being 95% caused by the other female driver.

I was backing out (game over; Insurance company stops listening at this point). I was going very slow, slower than I usually back out, maybe only 1 MPH (but speed kills )

I was at least 3/4 of the way out of my spot, well established in the lane, and had just begun to let my guard down looking at the rear view camera screen as I had decided I could back out straight all the way since there was parking lot roadway behind me, and not more parked cars. Normally at that point one would turn sharply to get out of the perpendicular parking spaces. In comes the lady from the side, maybe going as much as 20X faster than me, and boom. My right rear corner is hit, her two right doors are ""smashed in starting on the front of the passenger door."" How she didn't see me when I was so far backed out is beyond me. I was flabbergasted and dumbfounded. Clearly she was distracted, but won't admit to it further than saying ""I didn't see you."" She must of been 2 car lengths past me before stopping! She must have not been driving on the right side of the parking lot roadway either to have avoided broadsiding me. Luckily for me, she bascially pushed my car diagonally out of the way an inch or two, so the damage is all localized as minor scuffing to the rear bumper under the taillight assembly, a hairline crack in the taillight, and a tiny scuff above the taillight, with holes and damage to the plastics underneath the painted bumper.

Unfortunately for me, I was in reverse, and backing out, although my motion was near motionless as compared to the Earth. Still, I couldn't honestly say I was stopped, and I knew that was my doom. Sure enough, Geico caved in with little pressure and assessed me blame as I had predicted.

I honestly think the only way to have avoided this type of driver is to have used MORE SPEED. Back out with authority, making the time you are backing out less, and therefore giving fewer seconds to those that will target you like a heat sinking missile while you are vulnerable to insurance ""rules of thumb."" Had I done that, I either could have avoided her by continuing to back out faster and faster out of her path, or, at least, been hit broadside which would be more her fault as she apparently wins by beating me to the spot (20 MPH vs. 1 MPH), I was a sitting duck!

Unbelievable she ruins my streak of no-at-fault accidents in a parking lot where I was moving at a slow 1 MPH and nothing was behind me, until there was of course. Plain 7:30 PM dusk; still plenty of light out; no need for headlights yet. Wish I would have got a picture of her car, much more damaged along both doors she must have dragged around my rear corner.","I'm just curious, is anything ever your fault?","Grrr.... You'd think if you backed straight into someone's side you'd have damage all across the back end, and not just on the corner rear side.... again I come back to thinking being self-insured would be better, if only to stand up for myself against the other insurance company rather than lay down like Geico did.","
Absolutely. I take blame when blame is due. Like when I was a teenager and rear-ended somebody at about 5 MPH; thankfully there was no visible damage. My car had a damaged license plate and that's about it. I suppose the license plate frame showed plastic stress ""coloring"" from being compressed.

I'm still thinking the photos show more of a ""side"" impact than they do my rear going into her. The damage clearly shows fast motion from the right to the left. Not from being compressed inward.","
According to Geico, this one was, as it apparently serves my interests to just accept 100% liability so that they don't come after me for ""more."" I don't think I'm buying what Geico was selling there in telling me that, but that's what they said.

My belief is that accepting 100% liability for small claims following generic rules of thumb serves only insurance company interests, as it keeps them from having to do any real investigative work in assessing fault. Insurance companies give each other the same courtesy, so it balances out for them, while assessing far more blame to driver's that don't deserve it, at the same time as assigning far less blame to those that do deserve blame, but receive none.

I'm not referring to my own case with this statement. I've seen this repeatedly from other claims I've heard about or seen, as well as my own from decades past.

I really need to get a dash cam, front and rear, but I'm afraid without left and right cams, they'd of been useless in my most current situation.","Dashcams (front and rear), and always back into spots whenever possible. I see so many witless idiots zooming around parking lots like they are normal roads.","Your damage looks so small compared to ""crushing her two doors in"". Weird how those things go.","
I was shocked when I saw her 2012 or 2013 Civic's damage! After seeing my Alltrack's damage, I was NOT expecting what I saw on her Civic. It's almost as if her Civic hinged on my right rear corner. Now were not talking doors popping open or unusable/inoperable (I don't think). Just sheet metal damage from front to back.","
Maybe a Google 360 Degree cam is needed. She couldn't have been in my rear frame for more than a split second flash as she whizzed by me. I suppose in a major case you could pull frames of video per second to assess her speed. She couldn't have made more than a few frames of video even in the wide angle lens such as that of the car's own camera (but no video) view.

But as we all know, I'm not into blaming speed, I just think she wasn't looking. How do you not see a white car with rear reverse lights, and rear brake lights on? My foot was most definitely on the brake, not because I saw her about to be flying into me, but because I was backing up slowly with a DSG auto transmission at idle. Without brakes, you'd back up much faster than I did.","andres3 said:

By the description of the damage to her vehicle she had to be behind you or just almost so when you started backing out. Otherwise how would you have damaged her car doors. If you were at least 3/4ths of the way out and she came by and hit you her damage would have been far more towards the front. based on where you say her damage was I would tend to believe your insurance company did the right thing.","
OK, so I'm trying to avoid this ever happening again, and the idea of backing into spots did come up. I do fail to see how it helps much, as with both methods, you are backing either out of or into a space at least once.

Only an empty parking lot where you can pull froward into the space in the adjacent lane that your facing forward improves this. I suppose your backing INTO a space rather than OUT Of one, but the mere act of backing up makes you vulnerable to being deemed at-fault should anyone ram into you. I want to avoid reverse gear.

My father was recently hit by a Toyota driver while he was reversing and parallel parking INTO a parking space. The Toyota driver decided he was taking too long apparently, and rammed directly into his front left side that was still sticking out as he was backing into the space. Even in this case, where he was basically rear-ended to the front left side, the mere act of backing up made him 50% at fault according to his insurance company.

He probably should have fought harder, but I understand giving up.","andres3 said:

On August 12, 1973 we went to Lunsford Toyota on Oxnard Blvd and picked out a brown Toyota Corona as our new car for my mom. I think they paid $2900 for it. That car lasted 8 years, and I have quite a few memories of it. I remember my mom being able to fill the gas tank with $5. I remember adding a cassette deck to it so I could play the latest songs in it. I remember taking my driving test in it. I also remember the day when I was involved in an accident on my way to high school that ultimately totaled it.

August 12, 1973 also happened to be my dad's 38th birthday. He would have been 83 today. I've been thinking about, and missing him, quite a lot these past few days.

Happy birthday, dad!",My neighbors work for the same company and get company cars.  '16 and '17 Jetta SEL.  The company utilized  TDIs until they were bought back.,"My dad passed in August 1991; he wasn't a real car guy, but he did own a few Mustangs, a Torino GT(with the shaker hood), and a Mark VII LSC. He also had a 1973 V8 Bronco which I inherited- a truly miserable vehicle- I think the people that have fond memories of them today must have been doing some serious mind-altering drugs at the time they drove or owned them.","
Those Toyotas looked pretty nice for their time. Your dad must have been adventurous to buy a very early Toyota. I think most people were pretty skeptical of Toyotas in the early days. I remember one rumor that if you scratched the paint off of a Toyota you would find they were made of tomato juice cans. Not nice, but, that is what they ""jokingly"" said.

My dad loved cars...he could even fix them....unlike me. He also loved gadgets like crystal radios, transistor radios, early TVs but especially cars. He would have loved to drive a modern car with all the new toys.","
Before the Toyota, they owned VWs - an early 60's Beetle and a '68 Squareback. The Squareback had an engine failure which put them in the market.

I remember going with my dad to the Mazda lot and looking at both the RX-2 and RX-3, so he was pretty adventerous when it came to my mom's cars. Even though my dad drove a '70 Chevy pickup, I don't think he ever considered a domestic brand for my mom.

The Toyota was replaced with a '72 MB 220 diesel, which my mom hated every day they owned it.","These last few posts brought back a funny memory for me. Back around 1969 or so I got a subscription to Road Test magazine. It claimed to be different from R&T, C&D and Motor Trend in that it did not take advertising from car manufacturers. It was a fairly bare-bones publication but I liked their different point of view.

One of the things that they did early on was test a lot of those new Japanese cars that were just making an impact. They seemed to generally love them and gave most of them favorable reviews. One I recall clearly was the Mazda 808, the piston-engine version of the RX-3, which they raved about. We had a newly-minted Mazda dealer in town - the typical style back then of being in a converted service station - and when the parents were in car-buying mode around 1971 I talked them into going to look at one there because it came in a station wagon version, which Dad thought would be useful in his real estate business.

Aside from the small size, what struck both them and me the most was how cheap everything seemed, from the thickness of the metal and the sound the doors made when closing, to the plasticky seat and door panel upholstery, pretty much everything. They didn't even bother taking one for a drive after sitting in and looking at them in the small showroom, and I couldn't really disagree. It made me wonder a bit about Road Test magazine.

Later on I saw a letter to the editor complaining about their bias towards Japanese cars they reviewed. The author said that he had sent them a cheque for a subscription and when the cancelled cheque came back from the bank it had a cancellation stamp from the Bank of Tokyo. It made me wonder just how independent they actually were.","Will be driving my son and grandson to the airport in a few hours. Boy, did the time fly - 3 nights and off they go.

Hey, I actually got a rainstorm this afternoon, dropped about 3/4 of an inch, and I was very happy to see it. We can get very dry and dusty here in July and August. Add in the Sahara dust, and yes, I was outside playing in the rain myself.","Kirstie, it's interesting ta know that my problem logging on to the New World Order Edmunds.com with my desktop is a mystery.

I can speculate but instead I simply offer it as something that needs to be looked into.","We've had a lot of rain this summer. Many times I don't even have to mow my lawn in August.
This year, I'm mowing multiple times per week, some of that due to trying get some of it done before the next rainfall.","I want to preface my comment with the fact that I have not been to a movie theater to watch a movie in over 6 years - I have Netflix, HBO, SHO, STARZ, EPIX, to name a few, on my cable at home. So watching movies or ordering movies currently playing is what I do in order to watch in the comfort of my home.

Now for my comment:

My grandson wants to go to the movies this afternoon to see ""Ant Man and The Wasp"" (a movie I have been wanting to see for as long as I can remember - UGH!). So, being computer literate, as I am, I go online and found a brand new theater just 5 minutes from the house. I look up the movie and start to select my seats. I follow all the instructions and the total amount came to $38.96. Did I understand and read that right? $38.96? You've got to be kidding. So I look at the individual pricing and for adults (13 years old and above) the price per ticket is $11.50 and for seniors (like me) the price is $9.98. When you add taxes and ""convenience fee"", you are at $38.96. I almost excreted a ""brick""! Just under $40.00 for 3 people to watch a movie.

Then, of course, they will want popcorn, soda, pretzel, hot dogs - whatever, and I am probably closer to $100.00. My cable bill is only $89.00 (the HOA pays $36.00) a month which includes ""Blast"" internet, expanded cable, STARZ, NETFLIX, HBO, SHO, EPIX, all on their X-1 system with HD. See where I'm going.

You guys who have kids or like to go to the movies with your SO or spouse must cringe every time you go to the movie theater. That's big bucks for a 2 hour movie in a theater with kids screaming, yelling, running up and down the aisle...., etc.

So, rather than get reserved seats right now, I figured I would buy the tickets at the theater and save a few bucks, but before we leave, we will check seating to make sure we can get some halfway decent seats. If we can't, I'll have to reserve the seats.

This trip to fly my son and grandson in from CA for a 3 night stay has already cost me $2500 if you include my son's overdue phone bill balance, new phone fees, dinner Friday, dinner last night, shoes and clothes for both as my gift, movies, etc.. This does not include my electric bill which will be outrageous since they like it cool in the house and leave all the TV's on, lights on, and very long hot showers.

But I'm not through - there is still dinner out tonight at the Steak House, breakfast out tomorrow morning, lunch out tomorrow afternoon, and then they leave for home at about 5:00 PM.

But then I remember it's only money and I don't get to see my son or grandson very often. UGH!","At least it gets an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, and your family is going to love it. And, sometimes going to a movie is special, compared to Netflix.
Now $17 popcorn and $5 Coke.....that I can't do.
My guess is, the movie will cost less than dinner, and they will like it a lot more.
I would of done Chick-a-fil for dinner........you shouldn't have to be Disney Dad.
However, if you really have to do it, you don't see them too often, so amortize the cost over 2 or 3 years.

Eat before or after. They don’t need fancy dinners all the time either. But it does add up if you eat every meal out. We have all 3 adult kids plus fiancé visiting.

We usually go out for one meal and I find it’s more relaxing if we go to an informal restaurant with great vibes where everyone can have fun. It is more expensive because I don’t frequent chain restaurants. My expenses total nowhere near $2500 but it ain’t cheap either. You did decide to gift those other items, so your call. You can also set boundaries. Everyone here know there’s a water shortage, so no long showers. If you leave a room, turn off the lights. We don’t have AC, so close doors when you go out.

I am an AMC Stubs member and take advantage of what it offers. I tend to earn a good bit of reward money, for one thing. It also allows free upgrades at the concession stand. We ONLY buy popcorn and I have water bottles in my jacket pockets (they crank the AC, so a jacket is necessary in all seasons), and that means I get a large bucket for the price of a medium. The bucket comes with free refills. We always go to the first show of the day, which is significantly cheaper: $6.50 a seat. They are also currently running a special where every show on Tuesdays is just $5. My wife almost never goes, so, for example, last Tuesday was $25 total for 3 tickets and a bucket of popcorn ($9).","

There are a lot of 6 cylinder cars out there that can eat that 69 Boss. Now I had a friend in high school that had a 69 Boss 429 and if memory recalls it was a bit faster to 60 than 7.1 seconds.

It is easy for the young'uns to forget that for many years a sub-7 second 0 to 60 time meant you were driving a very fast car.

As I've mentioned before I have a 1991 magazine that is a compilation of road tests from the old Hi-Performance Cars magazine. The fastest 1/4 mile time was a 12.5 posted by a 1969 Motion Performance big block Camaro- with 4.10 gears, uncapped headers and slicks. Aside from that car most of the others put up 1/4 mile ETs in the 13.5-14.5 second range. Those times are on the SLOW side of average for performance cars these days.

Yes, they are. And thanks for the kind words, Kirstie. I only get to see my son once a year and my grandsons infrequently. I wish I could fly - doctors just won't let me. It's 3 hours to DFW and another 3 hours to PSP. Then add an hour or two for layover, and it just is too much stress on my body. I have a deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) in my left femoral vein. That's why I take blood thinners. Sitting for that long a time in one spot is dangerous, according to the doctors. So, I take what ever I can get from bringing them here from California.","

The sorting issue is being caused by an issue with the tagging which is what the sorts are based on. Nothing at all to do with the login. It's been reported to the people who take care of those issues.

For now, if you're looking for discussions on any particular topic or make/model, just remember the newer discussions will be found on the LAST page of discussions until the tagging issue is resolved.

It's odd that you couldn't change your old email address. A couple of years ago I wandered into the ""Profile"" section here in the forums and saw that the defunct email address I had used years before to sign up here was still listed. But it was an editable field, so I changed it to my new email address and it took it. The next time I had to log in to the forums I entered that along with my old original password and all was well.

What happens here for you when you go into the profile section and try to edit that old email address?","Good thing you did it when you did AB, otherwise we might have to charge you a tariff","

Hope I'm misunderstanding.","the avatars actually are not part of Edmunds. That is a separate deal, I believe through gravatar.com (which is connected to Wordpress it seems).

For the fun of it I am making this post from my PC before I logged out then back in. So other than my red face mug shot, when I looked at my old profile I see the old (incorrect) email and I still see all my badges along with 330 Like's and 661 LOL's.

Earlier today the problems surfaced when I logged out then back in with my dumb phone. That is when I had to become @jmonroe1, which BTW doesn't even show on the pick list when you enter the @ sign on the old site but I see there is a jmonroe4. Talk about a wannabe, that guy is at the top of that list.

Now to answer your question when I went into the profile section on this new system. I don't see an editable spot for your email now like on the old system but like I have said before I couldn't correct the old incorrect email anyway, so nothing really lost now with no editable email box. All I see is 5 boxes for providing info.

I am not going to log out and then back in on my PC until the system glitches and I have to.

The system is doing what it does correctly.

ALL the computers and devices I had previously used to access the forums where I had the device remember that I was signed in, let me back in, for lack of a better term, ""under the old system"".

Has it had an oil change?
Nope.  89 days until what the service monitor system displays as the first A Service.  I checked with the service manager and he said at the 1-year old date which is in sync with the service reminder.  He further said that with so few miles on the car, the factory oil (Mobil 1 synthetic) is guaranteed for up to 24 months, but Mercedes wants an oil and filter change at 1 year or 10,000 miles, which ever comes first.

The A Service (10,000, 30,000, 50,000 miles or every other year) is more than oil and filter change.  It also includes some HVAC filter changes, brake inspection, top off all fluid levels, at an approximate cost of $400.  It takes about 2 hours to complete.  I belong to the Mercedes Benz Club of America so I get a 15% discount on all parts and labor.

The B Service is the expensive one - about $800 and is performed at 20,000, 40,000, 60,000 miles, etc.  That is an all day affair.

MB vehicles are by no means inexpensive to maintain.","

Nice tip stickguy Right out of the Helpful Hints book","
Back then I think you were only posting in the old ""Cars I Really Kinda Like"" board, which meant almost all your posts were on-topic.","I filled the tank of the S450 yesterday at Costco.  I paid $305.9 a gallon for PUG.  That price is about 20 cents a gallon cheaper than any gas station within 5 miles of where I live.  I thought gasoline prices were dropping but I guess I was wrong.  

Between higher gas prices, higher food prices, etc.  I suspect inflation is increasing even with the rise in interest rates.  I wonder if we’ll see higher prices on imported new cars and SUV’s.  Much is dependent on the price of steel and aluminum as well as pending tariffs on imported cars.  Time will tell.","There has been inflation in products from food on for a decade, but it doesn't seem to show much in the indices that the government has organized to document it. A major problem in the food and products chain is the difficulty in getting truck drivers.

Paying more for drivers with the increase in wages, along with the several years now of tighter controls on how long a driver can drive and the pattern of their driving time has increased the need for more drivers. Drivers aren't getting buy with fudging their books like they used to do so they could drive for 20 hours and get the loads there at more profit for them and their trucking company.

I listen to the night radio show when I wake and can't get back to sleep (700, WLW, ATN). That is a show populated by truck drivers calling in to talk about things. The booming economy is letting more of them get more pay, often by switching companies. That means products at the stores will cost more.

Many drivers have gone to specialty trucking--the box trucks and cargo vans that run dedicated routes every day with a definite time schedule and more pay. And they are home and leaving at the same time most days.","I knew it was up, but over $300? Ouch. A 5 grand fillup!

Remember email at help@edmunds.com if you have trouble.","MB prepaid maintenance can be a deal if you find the right offer.
",Somehow an Acura dealer can do the same thing for $60.,"Many cost of living factors don't appear to make it into any official inflation stats. Housing costs, utilities costs, medical care costs, transportation costs (vehicle, fuel, insurance) etc don't seem to be slowing down or doddering at a ~3% rate as the talking heads want us to believe. Electronics are generally cheaper than ever, travel can be cheap, but I don't buy a new TV or go to Europe once a week. Wages have also been effectively stagnant for many for a long time.
","My Bluetec is in that same boat. Hilariously high residual - with 9 months left, market value is already under residual, and the depreciation curve is still fairly steep. I suspect there will be at least a 5K difference at the end of the term.

I was told by a few people not long ago that MB doesn't negotiate the residual if you want to buy it out at the end of a lease - but a local sales manager told me they will, we'll see how that goes.

He’ll probably say something like, “...if you can afford an S450, a check for a couple thousand dollars for your one an only “poor” son would be nice. Dad!”  I would probably respond, “...would love to son, but I can’t afford it right now with these car payments on my back!”  

I’ll give him the money anyway - he definitely needs the financial help - he works from 5:00 AM to 4:30 PM every day and has private clients some evenings and weekends.  Thank God for the scholarship for my older grandson for college."

Your profiles aren't merged and they shouldn't look like they are. There is currently no connection between the Insider login and your forums login, so if you aren't seeing things like screen name, etc., that's how it's supposed to be.

ONLY when we flip the switch, which looks like sometime tomorrow, will you notice a change. So, if it doesn't look like it's working right now, that's because there's been no change. It's only on our testing environment at the moment, and a bunch of us have tested and tested, so we feel confident that when the switch is made, it's not going to be painful.

No need to worry about the email confirmation, either. You're already in the database as a confirmed member - the old database. So, if you don't confirm with Insider, it's not going to create a problem. As long as your Insider email address matches the one you use in forums, you should be merged seamlessly.","Removed a post that was going to do nothing but take us into politics.

Multiple times, last was this morning.

Click my name and PM me","On the lighter side of life (as opposed to ""insider"" log in problems here on Edmunds), when I completed my walk at the mall this morning, I texted my son to find out if there were any last minute things he wanted me to stock up on for the weekend in terms of snacks, food, drinks, etc. I received a text back from him and his suggestions included:

1. Pick up some Cheese flavored Gold Fish because Troy likes those to snack on.

2. Pick up some bananas because Troy likes to eat them in the morning.

3. Try to get some hot dogs, salami, bread, cheese, etc., because he likes that stuff too.

I texted him back questioning what the heck Cheese Flavored Gold Fish were. He said just look at the Pepperidge Farm display and you'll see them. I said OK. But isn't there something you would like me to get in the way of food or snacks for you - he replied no.

So, I go over the Publix and weave in and out of hexagenerians in the aisles looking for ""Gold Fish"". I see them on the ""2 for 1"" list and pick up two bags. But there is a sign next to them and it says, ""...these are fresh and are not contaminated by salmonella! Holy Cow! I couldn't figure out what the heck that sign meant. So I go online with my iPhone to look up ""Gold Fish - Salmonella"". It states there was a recall of 4 different kinds of Gold Fish from Pepperidge Farm and Ritz snacks and Gold Fish from Nabisco due to salmonella back in early July. I had not read or heard anything about that recall. But, since Publix was selling them again and posted that alert, I figured I was OK.

Next, I go over the cheeses and deli products and pick up Hebrew National Hot Dogs and Salami.

I then went over to produce but the bananas were all pretty yellow (ripe) and would probably be over-ripe by Friday. The guy who handles produce went back and brought out some ""greenish/yellowish"" bananas and told me to leave them out - that they would be perfect for Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Thank heavens for professionals who know what they are doing.

I was about to head toward the check-out registers when this little old lady pokes me on my ""derriere"" (she was kind of short and probably couldn't tap me on my back or shoulder) and asks if I would be kind enough to squeeze the nectarines for her to find out if they were ripe enough to eat today. I said of course and proceeded to pick up one nectarine after another trying to get a few that would ""pucker"". Not one of those nectarines was ripe - they were as hard as rocks. I told the little lady. She then asked if I would be kind enough to pucker some peaches. Not one of the peaches was ripe enough to eat today. When she then asked me to squeeze the iceberg lettuce, I said to her, ""...I've squeezed as much produce this morning as I care to squeeze..."" and pointed her over to the produce manager who helped me with my bananas earlier.

Why do I seem to attract the strangest people? Maybe it's my face - so kind and gentlemanly-looking. I must look like the perfect patsy for hexagenerians.

I then go to the check-out and when the register clerk finished scanning everything, she asked if I was signed up for the $5.00 special for $50.00+ purchases this week. I said I did't know. She said to put my 10 digit phone number into the scanner, which I did, and low and behold, $5.00 off plus another $1.00 for the laundry detergent I bought. I need to buy a powerball jackpot ticket tomorrow.

You didn't do anything wrong. That search box on the Insider page won't bring you to the forums. You will get there just like you always have, whether you have it in your favorites/bookmarks on your browser or if you just type something like forums.edmunds.com in Google.

The only ""change"" is that there will be a new login system, which you won't even really see. When the change takes place, the first time you come to the forums, you will sign in with your email and PW (possibly new, if you needed to make it longer like I did). Then you will be logged in and playing in the forums, same as ever.

But with the new login, you will now be logged in for the entire site, not just the forums. As you pointed out, the search box on the Insider page is NOT the way to get here. Up at the top of that page, and on ANY page on the site you'll see the Research tab:

Love your new “facelift”!  Boy, you are one good lookin’ guy, jmonroe.  A true Adonis with a squared jaw.  I hope you didn’t pay very much - but knowing you, you probably had an intern do the facelift! ","Here's a question.

Since the last facelift I haven't been able to access the forums except by going to google and entering Edmunds Fourms-Cars and Conversations. I then select some old post to click on in order to enter. PITA but it works.

Under the new system will that still be possible?",you should just have to go to the edmunds home page and click on the forms link (or insider).,"
I never found a forums link on the current version of Edmunds homepage. 

If if you enter the web address forums.edmunds.com it should take you there directly. 

The link to get to the discussions you bookmarked is https://forums.edmunds.com/discussions/bookmarked","that is what I type in to get there (or out of bookmarks). But if you look hard enough, there is a link on the Edmunds.com home page to the forums. On the research tab, under articles and advice.",You can also look at the site map and click on the categorized view.,"
I can never get the site map to load.

It isn't really on the home page if you have to hunt for it on another page, though.","

If Edmunds ever tried to send me an email, I'll never get it at the email shown in my profile. When the system glitches, I have to remember the wrong email to get in here but that has always worked.

ST. ALBANS, Vt. (WCAX) We have new details about a quick stop robbery that sparked a police chase that eventually ended in St. Albans Bay.

It all started Saturday night when police say Stephen Salyer, 38, of Enosburgh, robbed an Enosburgh Maplefields and ran off. Witnesses had spotted an ankle monitor on the robber, so police were able to get a location on Salyer by using surveillance video and the GPS tracking device on his ankle.

Officers say they tried to pull the car over, but they say Salyer took off and led them on a 30-minute chase. Spike strips were used, but that didn't stop the car, which eventually reached St. Albans Bay. Police say Salyer drove out onto the dock and right into Lake Champlain. The vehicle sank to the bottom and investigators say Salyer got out and started to swim away from his vehicle, further into the lake.

Police eventually caught up with him and he was sent to the hospital for his injuries.

Bail was set at $25,000.","

Would also like to know. Do I need an ""insider"" account? Why? 

Insider is going to be the new registration for the whole site. Integrates the whole thing. So someone who shows up and hasn't yet discovered the joys of the forums, won't need to create a new account. I've had an Insider acct for a while and now I'll only have ONE PW to remember (or write down)

There will be no ""outsider"" login, just a single login","Like it says in the login systems change thread, this will be pretty straightforward.

If you haven't created an Insider account before the change, you'll simply create the account the first time you login after the change. Just be sure to use the same email you login with now so that all your badges follow you

And as long as we're quoting funny people...

Yes, they did. They want to try and sell more burgers so have become Ihob.

IHOP's decision to rebrand as IHOb baffled many pancake lovers .

But according to the chain's president, there was a very specific strategy behind the change. And the burger-centric revamp began more than a year before the IHOb brand went viral over the past week.

Last Monday, IHOP — the International House of Pancakes — announced it would change its name to IHOb, flipping the ""P"" to a ""b.""

One thing I do wonder about, though, and I've never seen it - when people are building a garage, why can't they depress the floor a bit in the center of a vehicle parking area?

The ""long course"" is about a mile in length, and simulates a standard 2 lane road with a double yellow line. A few low speed corners and a decently long straight stretch, interrupted by a slalom with 6-7 gates. Decent elevation changes, too (the video I linked to earlier is the facility). This is in no way a race track - there are no run off areas. The ""short course"" is set up for autocross; lots of low speed corners and one short straight stretch. The local SCCA was out to monitor and time the autocross portion. We split into two groups, and I went onto the long course first. We had a pace car - 2001 Z3M, driven by one of the SCCA hot shoes. First lap was orientation, 2nd and 3rd laps were at speed. Due to some scheduling delays, our group was only able to do 3 sets of laps. Fortunately, I was able to drive one of them - in an X3 M40i. Way more fun than I expected - I was able to break 80 MPH on the straight stretch, before the slalom. I was complimented by one of my passengers that I was using an appropriate racing line (there were no professional drivers accompanying us). Unfortunately, the doofus who had the M4 three cars in front of me didn't seem to understand the concept of what the right pedal was for, so I wasn't able to really exercise the car. I rode shotgun in both the X3 as well as in an X5 50i. The X5, my friends, is a seriously fast SUV. Except the driver nailed one of the slalom cones on the last lap. And, the M550i in front of us was going way faster. On to the short course. There were 4 vehicles available - the M4 (after the first laps on the long course, the event organizers swapped it and another car out for two others), a 440i 6-speed, an X2 and a 650i GC. I drove the X2 twice, and the 440i and 650i GC once each. I saw two times for my laps - 46.1 in the X2 and 45.9 in the 650. I kept the 440i in 2nd gear the whole lap, but didn't see a time. I was pretty impressed with the X2; I pushed it to the limit the second time around and was able to induce a short 4-wheel drift on one of the tighter turns. Startled me into lifting off the throttle for a moment. The 650 was surprisingly agile, as well, for something so big. I have a new found appreciation for the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" tag line, and I also learned that I'm a lousy passenger when cars are being driven in anger. Wish I had the opportunity to do another half dozen laps, in the same car. I was starting to learn the course and figure there was time to shave. All in all, a pretty fun day, even though a bunch of ""bros"" tried jumping the queue for extra seat time in the M4 and 440i.
Thanks for the warning, Michaell

No I didn’t, Michaell.  I always enjoy your posts, long or short.  But some posters here go a bit overboard on one huge post after another - usually describing experiences in traffic court, speeding, speed limits, etc.  I mean, c’mon, how is it possible to write tens of thousands of words on that one topic?  Day after day, week after week, month after month.....ugh!

This was going to be the final test in order to consider me cured of Hep C since the 2 previous test detected no virus.

I waited 2 weeks for results.  My doctor got the results last Friday - “unable to complete test for Hep C”!  My doctor called the lab only to find out they mishandled the blood or lost the specimen!  

Anger and ire cannot adequately describe my outrage.  This test was critical in determining if the virus had been eliminated or if it was active.  Now, I have to go to the lab again this Thursday to have them stick me another 4-5 times until they find a vein (I am a hard “stick).  Then I have to wait another 10-14 days to get results.

LabCorp accepted responsibility but what good is that going to do me?  They said there would be no charge for the retest.  Well thank you LabCorp!  Awful!","@sb55,
A couple weeks ago, on the way back from vacation I saw an airstream with Vermont plates ahead of me.

That’s awful! I’m so sorry. As one who is also a “hard stick” and who has regular lab draws, that’s really a drag. But that it’s the Hep C test makes it even worse. I remember my friend waiting for those results and being so elated when they arrived with good news. That’s really disheartening.","It's an Autobot though, so it's OK.

Interesting story. I've never seen a AAA service truck with an air gun. I see air compressors on road service trucks for the big 18 wheelers, but not the ones intended for ordinary passenger cars.

If the first AAA service tech did indeed overtighten the lug nuts to that extreme, then I would want to have the brake rotor checked, make sure it didn't get warped.","
I think air gun was a misnomer. I was there for the second call and that guy used a portable impact driver to take them off. Sounded just like the air gun at the garage.

So now we have to worry that his brakes are screwed up too? Yikes! As it is I've concluded with the size of the slash, the damage had to have been done while the car was parked at my house. That means someone may have come in at night to deliberately cause damage. I of course am now wondering if it was one of the characters who entered my house last week seeking revenge for calling the police. I really hope it's just my paranoia acting up.","
As bad as that is it's probably better than if they had screwed up and given you a false positive. It's scarey how these lab companies mess up lab results when people's lives depend on them. I remember a 60 Minutes story some years ago where min. wage lab techs were so overworked that they had a high percentage of incorrect results which caused some people to undergo major surgery unnecessarily.","Mr M. I read your report in it's entirety and found it interesting....I almost always like to hear how the common man views driving various cars.
Not to upset anyone, but would that driving day have been as much fun if you were road testing, say, new Buicks?","Mike....really sorry to hear they lost the all important lab results. Giving you a free one when they lost the original is insulting. They should give you your results within 24 hours for their mistake, and give you a gift certificate for a nice dinner.....or, free lab results in the future.","
I don't want to get into an argument about this but I seriously doubt that over tightened lug nuts will warp a rotor. IMO, the rotor studs would shear off long before the rotor is damaged. However, I'd be much more concerned that when over torqueing is done that the studs will have been stretched beyond their elasticity limit for that given material. One of the best ways to do this is to take the over torqued studs to a materials lab and have them X-rayed to check the grain structure of the over torqued stud and compare it to that of a new stud. Material labs do this all day long and are very good at it but it takes time and money to run the battery of tests required for accurate testing. This being the case, if a car owner is that concerned about over torqueing ruining the studs, the best thing to do is replace the over torqued studs. In fact, I even know someone that did just that because even with his 3/4 inch pneumatic wrench he could not get a few lug nuts loose. If I had to guess, I'd say that around 50% of the cars on the road today have some lug nuts over torqued to some degree beyond the recommended torque specs for their car and the owners have no idea about this because they never touch their lug nuts themselves. It's comforting to know that designers have chosen studs with enough margin to allow for bad installations, otherwise we would hear about this many, many times every day.

FWIW, and once again it is very coincidental since we are on this subject, I read in the Click and clack article this morning in the Sunday paper about a 1972 VW Van that had over torqued lugs nuts. When the owner ""heard a loud clunking on the front passenger side"", she pulled over. When the hub cap was removed she saw ""one lonely lug nut in place the rest had sheared off"". If anyone thinks over torqued lug nuts is a very rare occurrence, I feel sorry for them.

As you say it is an assumption, you really have no idea why that person was pulled over. Maybe due to making unsafe lane changes, or not using signals, or on a cell phone, or expired plates, or having ketchup on your hotdog (illegal here in Chicago), or any other reason. 
That's not true. I have these things called eyeballs, two of them, and they work great. I also have superior powers of observation while I""m driving. I'd have noticed an unsafe lane change, not using signals, or cell phone use in many cases, if they had occurred. Expires plates, I'm not paying attention for that, as it doesn't affect my safety. How would the Officer know that from their typical hidden positions? License plate readers? Would they pull someone over for only that reason without being certain their records are not faulty? Seems very far-fetched.

I doubt I've earned more than one circle in all my days on this Earth. That was from the irate Santee Sheriff that batted 1 for 2 in court against me.

It'll only took one cop telling me ""tell it to the judge!"" to hold all roadside arguments for the judge. I haven't argued a case roadside ever since, and that was in my teen years!

I remain as respectful and professional as possible, with the utmost integrity. Since my very first experience in Court as a teen showed me that the Courts lacked integrity, I've been going back over and over waiting for the day they might show some. The County Seat in San Diego has shown me some integrity in the past. They have granted my rightful and legal motions, the same exact motions that other courts have wrongfully denied, and more!

As I've said, maximum speed ticket violations are difficult to argue, and the CHP almost always shows up. I've never had a very strong argument for any of those violations. Basic speed law is different, and as I've pointed out, many of my biggest grievances come from ""off the wall"" vehicle code violations pulled out of an Officer's rear-end.","
Interesting. And no, no arguments. Your post made me curious, so I went and did a google search, found articles and forum posts defending both sides of this debate. It would appear that a temporary condition of over-tightening probably did not warp the rotor. Not tightening in the recommended star pattern, or over-tightening one but not all may cause a warped rotor over a period of time. At least that was the conclusion I reached after reading for about 10 minutes.

I know that over-tightening can definitely cause problems for the bolts. I remember watching someone trying to torque the head bolts on an old 6 cylinder Mustang (roughly a 1966 or 1967). This would have been back around 1978 or 79. He applied anti-seize compound to the threads before installing and then tried to torque with a torque wrench. I told him the torque specs were for ""dry"" conditions, but he didn't listen. You can probably guess the results.","@ab348,

If only the enforcement sector would go after or be told to go after more than simple speeders. The amount of ""drivers"" I see with phones in their hand, not signaling, violating green signaled crosswalks, turning into the wrong lane, etc is stupefying. Actually cracking down on more than speed might alleviate some stress from those who have to dodge idiots, especially on foot. On the other hand, this morning I saw a brave hardworking bootstrapper in a Tesla going maybe 60-70 in a 40, probably less likely to be nabbed for that than a 19 year old from a less affluent suburb speeding in a 20 year old Civic. But I guess that's how it goes, justice is not blind, they deserve the endless tax breaks, with more upcoming, as the entitled lucky ones like to lecture ""life isn't fair"", dopey libertarians will cry ""class warfare!"" if anyone questions this dumb status quo Given the perks and blind deference accumulated and held by the crime and punishment industry, no doubt even doubling the amount of citations would fail to fund that system. This isn't real world accountability. If speed demon's posts irk some, just skip them. It's not rocket surgery.
Most of us do not have any direct contact with traffic law inforcement activities because we obey or are in compliance with all traffic laws.  We don’t travel more than 3-5 mph over the speed limit; we stop at red lights and stop si.  Why?  Because they find the traffic laws too restricting for their driving preferences.  Tough, isn’t it!

If everyone obeyed the traffic laws, we would all be safer on the roads when we drive.  It’s because of those who violate traffic laws that accidents are on the rise.
Do we know what percentage of people are pulled over for each offense? We see someone pulled over so we automatically presume it's for speeding? How do we know it's not for cell phone use or not using turn signals or cutting someone off?
It's a pretty soild assumption when you see it happen in front/alongside/behind you. You are observing traffic, and you don't see any violations yourself, other than speeding, which everyone is doing, so when someone gets pulled over, pretty safe process of elmination. Also, if the fastest guy that just passed you gets pulled over, another prettty strong indicator.
As you say it is an assumption, you really have no idea why that person was pulled over. Maybe due to making unsafe lane changes, or not using signals, or on a cell phone, or expired plates, or having ketchup on your hotdog (illegal here in Chicago), or any other reason.

______________ Even when your guilty, you still have a right to have the ""People"" prove their case beyond a resonable doubt. There's also the 5th Amendment where you don't have to incriminate yourself. I see nothing wrong with forcing the State to do their job, and that is prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt with the Officer present. That goes to facing your accuser. If it was important enough for them to waste your time to stop you and write you a citation, it should be important enough to show up in court, and follow all the rules, laws, and procedures properly to win a conviction. If the State has to trample on several laws and rights in order to win convictions, something is wrong. I don't have much of a problem with losing, but the playing field should appear to be fair and level. It does not appear that way. The ""clerical"" errors that appear to be routine appear to me to not be ""errors"" at all, but designed to be subtle trampling of rights. Why are they so afraid of a fair trial? They will bend and/or break their own rules to avoid it. My letter telling them they were wrong in denying a Trial De Novo based on the 20-day time rule was a perfect example. My current open case where they wanted to ignore the citation and hold an appearance at a random court of THEIR choosing without giving me reasonable notification or communication and response, is another great example. Why are they so afraid of going by the book? Also, the fine revenue is more than a drop in the bucket. Remember, the fine isn't the only part of the citation. In CA, you pay more in fees and penalties than the original fine. They do this to avoid challenges to another right, and that is Cruel and Unusual Punishment. By not calling it a ""fine"" apparently the State thinks it's not a punishment.

Very few people can match the number of tickets I received in my misspent youth. Mostly speeding tickets asn, you know what? I deserved every one that was given to me. Once I failed to yield to a pedestrian that I didn't deserve. I went to court on every ticket I received. I was always the victim. The cop must have clocked the wrong car, etc. The pedestrian was a Wino who had waved me through the crosswalk. (True but I lost this one).

I think during that time I may have ""beat"" one or two of them through my willingness and ability to dispense a believable amount of BS that the judge gave me the benefit of the doubt. A couple of times, the cop didn't show up in court which in CA in those days gave me a free ride!

See Andres, how easy it can be?

In CA in the old days if you smarted off to a cop or acted like you knew more about the law then he did, the cop would draw a very small circle it the upper left of the ticket. He would make a small dot in the middle.

Today I attended, for the first time, a BMW Driving Event, sponsored by the local dealer. It was a two hour session, split equally between a ""long course"" and a ""short course"".

The facility is actually owned by the county, and is primarily used by law enforcement for high speed training and car control.

The ""long course"" is about a mile in length, and simulates a standard 2 lane road with a double yellow line. A few low speed corners and a decently long straight stretch, interrupted by a slalom with 6-7 gates. Decent elevation changes, too (the video I linked to earlier is the facility). This is in no way a race track - there are no run off areas.

The ""short course"" is set up for autocross; lots of low speed corners and one short straight stretch.

The local SCCA was out to monitor and time the autocross portion.

We split into two groups, and I went onto the long course first. We had a pace car - 2001 Z3M, driven by one of the SCCA hot shoes. First lap was orientation, 2nd and 3rd laps were at speed. Due to some scheduling delays, our group was only able to do 3 sets of laps. Fortunately, I was able to drive one of them - in an X3 M40i.

Way more fun than I expected - I was able to break 80 MPH on the straight stretch, before the slalom. I was complimented by one of my passengers that I was using an appropriate racing line (there were no professional drivers accompanying us). Unfortunately, the doofus who had the M4 three cars in front of me didn't seem to understand the concept of what the right pedal was for, so I wasn't able to really exercise the car.

I rode shotgun in both the X3 as well as in an X5 50i. The X5, my friends, is a seriously fast SUV. Except the driver nailed one of the slalom cones on the last lap. And, the M550i in front of us was going way faster.

On to the short course. There were 4 vehicles available - the M4 (after the first laps on the long course, the event organizers swapped it and another car out for two others), a 440i 6-speed, an X2 and a 650i GC. I drove the X2 twice, and the 440i and 650i GC once each.

I saw two times for my laps - 46.1 in the X2 and 45.9 in the 650. I kept the 440i in 2nd gear the whole lap, but didn't see a time.

I was pretty impressed with the X2; I pushed it to the limit the second time around and was able to induce a short 4-wheel drift on one of the tighter turns. Startled me into lifting off the throttle for a moment.

The 650 was surprisingly agile, as well, for something so big.

I have a new found appreciation for the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" tag line, and I also learned that I'm a lousy passenger when cars are being driven in anger.

Wish I had the opportunity to do another half dozen laps, in the same car. I was starting to learn the course and figure there was time to shave.

All in all, a pretty fun day, even though a bunch of ""bros"" tried jumping the queue for extra seat time in the M4 and 440i.","
Nice read! I really like the X2; BMW is supposedly working on an M Performance variant, and I could see owning one if it runs the quarter in the very low thirteens.","
I was prepared to not like the X2, from a driving point of view. I've seen a few on the roads and think they are pretty handsome. Time behind the wheel convinced me that it's got good driving dynamics, as well.

I'm still likely in the market for a sedan as my next DD, however.

A lot of the younger folks in attendance were more interested in drifting the cars than doing a fast time on the short course. Which was interesting, since I think everything but the M4 was xDrive. Could still see the RWD bias, however.","Michaell said:
Warning, long post ahead … skip if you're not interested in my experience at the BMW driving event today Today I attended, for the first time, a BMW Driving Event, sponsored by the local dealer. It was a two hour session, split equally between a ""long course"" and a ""short course"". The facility is actually owned by the county, and is primarily used by law enforcement for high speed training and car control. The ""long course"" is about a mile in length, and simulates a standard 2 lane road with a double yellow line. A few low speed corners and a decently long straight stretch, interrupted by a slalom with 6-7 gates. Decent elevation changes, too (the video I linked to earlier is the facility). This is in no way a race track - there are no run off areas. The ""short course"" is set up for autocross; lots of low speed corners and one short straight stretch. The local SCCA was out to monitor and time the autocross portion. We split into two groups, and I went onto the long course first. We had a pace car - 2001 Z3M, driven by one of the SCCA hot shoes. First lap was orientation, 2nd and 3rd laps were at speed. Due to some scheduling delays, our group was only able to do 3 sets of laps. Fortunately, I was able to drive one of them - in an X3 M40i. Way more fun than I expected - I was able to break 80 MPH on the straight stretch, before the slalom.

106,"Better than going to old posts, I dug up some old files, unfortuantely my ""court file"" is full of holes; getting new computers is always a hassle and over the years files have been lost..

I believe this is what I read/spoke in court on my motion hearing word for word:

Motion for Change of Venue

Your Honor, I request a change of venue to the Municipal Court at the county seat. I am making this request at, during, and/or prior to arraignment, as required by Penal Code Section 1462.2. However, due to the added complexities of my case, I first motion the court for dismissal, with change of venue as the alternative. The legal basis for my request is stated in my Declaration and Points and Authorities your Honor has on file.","Here's my only winning trial by declaration/mail of all-time:

Attachment #1A

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

Pursuant to vehicle code 40902, I wish to exercise my right to trial by declaration with regard to a vehicle code infraction citation. As required, I enclose a check for $148.00 bail. Please refund the same to me in the event the court finds me not guilty.

On January 26, 2006, at approximately 3:50 p.m., I was driving my 2003 Honda Accord LX Coupe, License No. 4ZXM826, south on 805 coming from Highway 56. My vehicle is dark gray in color (graphite). Please review attachment #1B, which contains a series of photographs along with a written description of what each photograph clearly demonstrates.

I have two main points of defense as follows:

1. Cited for vehicle code 21755VC violation, which never occurred according to the vehicle code’s very own definition, as I never “passed on shoulder.”
2. I never drove (and definitely didn’t pass anyone) on a shoulder, because the concrete lane I was in was an actual freeway lane and exit lane or off ramp.

First, the title of VC21755 is “pass on right safely,” or passing on shoulder as the officer wrote on my citation copy as the violation that allegedly occurred. This vehicle code does not apply to my case or to the situation that happened on 1/26/06. I never passed anyone on the right, I never passed anyone driving on the shoulder, and I never passed any vehicles on the freeway, period. I was planning on exiting the freeway at the next off ramp. I was already slowing down, as is the normal process in order to exit the freeway. You cannot pass people on the freeway when you are in the process of exiting the freeway, it just doesn’t make logical sense (you are headed different directions for one). Add to this that I had slowed down considerably, and you can know it is a fact that freeway traffic was moving faster than I was. The only vehicle I passed was the officer’s parked CHP car, and I passed it on the left as I merged carefully back onto the next lane over on the left in order to avoid a collision. I have a second attachment 1C that shows the address I was driving to and from where I came, which was 5951 Village Center Loop Road, right off of highway 56. I took the 805 South and was headed towards 9823 Pacific Heights Blvd., therefore, the map indicated to me that I was to exit the 805 South at Mira Mesa Blvd/Sorrento Valley Road, which is the first thing I told the officer who was blocking the right lane with his vehicle (although he was not inside his vehicle). The fact of the matter is that I never passed anyone on the right, I had slowed down significantly, and I had every intention of exiting the freeway.

Secondly, I, along with every other reasonable driver, both in front and behind of me, felt that the right lane was indeed a lane, and not a shoulder based on the overwhelming visual evidence on the freeway. Any reasonable person would view the asphalt lane as the shoulder, the concrete lane as the far right lane, and that lane eventually becoming the exit only lane. Most drivers probably assumed the solid white line was there to indicate that it is an “exit only” lane, and that you should not re-merge back onto the freeway.

I would like your honor to know that I included every single rearview photograph taken within 5 minutes of receiving my citation. I did not take 40 or 50 photos and edit the best 3 or 4 rearview pictures for my defense. I included each and every single rear-facing picture I took, because I wanted to make it clear that without intending it, every single picture happened to capture another vehicle coming down the exact same lane the officer cited me for driving on, which he claims was a shoulder. There were no lane closure signs; even a semi-truck came down the exact same lane the officer claimed was a shoulder. Also, the lane in question goes straight into and directly onto the right most exit lane. There is no need to turn or change lanes; it simply is the same lane. I find it unreasonable to assume that all of these driver’s could have misinterpreted the freeway lanes. The officer incorrectly assumed it was a shoulder, and double-parked his vehicle alongside the white truck.

Therefore, in conclusion, I should be found not guilty due to the fact that I never placed my vehicle onto a shoulder, and I never passed any vehicles on the freeway, regardless of whether the lane I was in would be considered a shoulder or not. I was on a main traveled portion of the roadway (as indicated by all the traffic using that lane of the roadway in my pictures. Lastly, even if I did pass vehicles to my left (passing on right, which I state I didn’t), I did so in a safe manner and under conditions permitting such movement in safety. I believe I did nothing illegal, as my physical actions were no different than if someone had decided to pull over to change a flat tire, then changed their minds, and safely pulled back onto the freeway so that they could change their flat tire elsewhere.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Presiding Judge
Superior Court of California, County of San Diego
Kearny Mesa Branch – Traffic/Minor Offense
8950 Clairemont Mesa Blvd.
San Diego, CA 92123-1187

To: Presiding Judge for Traffic Court

Re: Citation/Case Number 1471662 – Defendant: JOE COOL

I am writing the court today to have what I believe to have been a clerical error on the part of the Court in denying my Request for a Trial De Novo recently in case number 1471662.

Background Facts:

The clerk signed the certificate of mailing form TR-215 (Decision and Notice of Decision) as dated December, 31, 2013 on the case referenced above. The decision was postmarked January 2, 2014, most likely due to the Holiday at the New Year.

On January 17, 2014 the Defendant, Andres Dolson, completed a Request for a New Trial (Trial De Novo Form TR-220), and then proceeded to hand deliver the completed form to the Kearny Mesa Branch court on that same date at approximately 1:30 P.M. The defendant placed the form into an envelope provided at the outdoor drop-box by the front entrance doors to the court facility. The envelope was filled out by hand and I placed the date and time of the drop-off onto the envelope. If the court keeps the envelope on file, the court can confirm that I hand time-stamped the delivery at approximately 1:30 p.m. on 1/17/14 to the Request for a Trial De Novo. No electronic automatic stamp is provided at the court's outdoor drop-box.

On Friday, 17 January, the Court's business office has reduced hours, which is why I had fully and completely relied upon the court's outside exterior signage to follow directions and hand-in my request for a Trial De Novo in a timely fashion to meet all of the court's requirements by delivering the request well within the 20 days required from the clerk's certificate of mailing on the Trial By Declaration Decision. After depositing my delivery in the exterior drop-box outdoors, I noticed that although the business offices were closed due to reduced hours on Fridays, the court was still open for other matters such as Small Claims, and that the front doors were still open. It was then I noticed there was an indoor interior drop-box with an automatic electronic time stamp. Since I didn't have another copy of my TR-220 form, I time-stamped my court courtesy notice for this case/citation number to provide some proof that I was at the court on January 17, 2014 (see attachment “A” which is a 2 page copy of my time-stamped courtesy notice at January, 17, 2014 1:41 PM and 1:42 PM), taken just in case an unexpected adverse decision such as that provided on 1/23/14 was made by the court. I had no other business to drive over to the Kearny Mesa Branch, and be at the court on January 17 at approximately 1:41-1:42 PM other than to personally deliver my Request for a Trial De Novo Form TR-220 on the case number referenced above.




It should be noted that the outdoor drop-box has no such automatic time-stamp provided. However, I fully complied with the directions on the outdoor drop-boxes signage, which promises that if an item is deposited by 4:00 PM it will be considered as received by the court on that same business court date (see attachment “B” two photographs taken by me on 1/28/14 of the outdoor signage on the exterior drop-box in question). The directions on the signage are very clear, and based upon that it is certain that my delivery of the Request for a Trial De Novo should have been logged as received on January 17, 2014 by the court.

By my count 20 days after the Certificate of Mailing dated 12/31/13 would be 1/20/14, which was a Court Holiday. Even if the court logged my TR-220 submission as received on 1/21/14, it is my understanding that the request should have been granted as received on time due to that Holiday. I believe this is a possible cause of the error, since on 1/28/14 when I visited the court again to take photographs of the instructional signage on the court's drop-boxes, I noticed that there is a discrepancy as the interior drop-box has slightly different instruction than the exterior signage. The interior signage says if a submission is not time-stamped, that it will be logged as received on the following business/court date. The exterior drop box makes no mention of this as it specifically states same date regardless of whether it's stamped or not, nor does it make any exception or notation for shortened hours on Fridays. Form TR-220 also makes no mention of reduction to the 20 day time line due to potentially shortened hours on some court dates such as Fridays. The outdoor signage simply states that if an item is deposited by 4:00 PM on any court day Monday through Friday (which 17 January was in fact an active court date), then it will be logged as received on that same date. Therefore, since I relied upon and used only the exterior drop-box, the signage on that box is the one that should apply and take precedence in regards to this case.

Based on the above facts, the court should not have denied my Request for a New Trial (Trial De Novo) for the check marked reason of not having been received on time. Although the time-stamped courtesy notice is not definitive irrefutable proof the court received my Request for a Trial De Novo on 1/17/14, it is indeed powerful circumstantial evidence corroborating my story. I'm confident the request was received by the court 17 days after the court clerk's certificate of mailing. Please change the decision entered on the Form TR-225 dated 1/23/14, and grant my request for a new fair trial with the officer present so that I may face my accuser in a court of law. Also, please schedule my trial date and time.

Thank you, and Sincerely,



Joe Cool

It's a pretty soild assumption when you see it happen in front/alongside/behind you. You are observing traffic, and you don't see any violations yourself, other than speeding, which everyone is doing, so when someone gets pulled over, pretty safe process of elmination. Also, if the fastest guy that just passed you gets pulled over, another prettty strong indicator.
As you say it is an assumption, you really have no idea why that person was pulled over. Maybe due to making unsafe lane changes, or not using signals, or on a cell phone, or expired plates, or having ketchup on your hotdog (illegal here in Chicago), or any other reason.

The problem is you don't have any experience with traffic courts. Furthermore, another problem is you don't have any experience with California Traffic Courts. When you say ""taking responsibility for your actions"" what you really mean to say is paying a fine regardless of whether you are guilty or not. As to not making money on traffic enforcement, that's another lauaghable lie, for if it were true, all the Traffic Courts in America wouldn't object to putting all traffic fine revenue for the current fiscal year into an account in my name. They should be able to run just fine off of tax payer dollars; they don't need the fine money; give it to me then.
I do have experience with traffic courts, but none recently. In my younger days I have had plenty.

As for paying fines regardless of whether I am guilty or not is outright wrong. I can honestly say that for all the times I was pulled over I was guilty of the offense that the officer pulled me over for with the exception on one time. That one time the officer was mistaken about my plates being expired and as he came to my window stated that he thought my plates were expired but saw the sticker clearer after I pulled over and saw that they were not. He let me go immediately without checking my license (which legally he couldn't do anyway). 

But every other time I was in the wrong, I knew I was in the wrong and I did make the decision to be in the wrong. Now if some cases I did not agree with the law, but that really is no excuse. So in these cases I owed up to what I did and took responsibility for my actions. I didnt try to justify my actions and play the victim.

And yes when you cost out the salary of the officer, those that support him or her, the salary of the judge and the clerk of the court and any bailiffs and all that support them in their traffic law enforcement pulse all the equipment and building space and all that supports that. pluse any benefits paid the fines usually don't add up to any amount that covers it. ","These long, involved posts are examples of what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object. Fortunately we don't have to waste our time reading them.","Well JM, if you want to name Canadians all you really need to do is look at the long list of entertainers from there","
Most people do just pay; they count on that. Most States know not to be greedy, and keep fines low. CA is greedy; more people are fighting them. The courts are clogged with people fighting their tickets. Did I mention my next trial is in November; that was scheduled a while back too.","

Even when your guilty, you still have a right to have the ""People"" prove their case beyond a resonable doubt.

There's also the 5th Amendment where you don't have to incriminate yourself. I see nothing wrong with forcing the State to do their job, and that is prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt with the Officer present. That goes to facing your accuser.

If it was important enough for them to waste your time to stop you and write you a citation, it should be important enough to show up in court, and follow all the rules, laws, and procedures properly to win a conviction. If the State has to trample on several laws and rights in order to win convictions, something is wrong. I don't have much of a problem with losing, but the playing field should appear to be fair and level. It does not appear that way.

The ""clerical"" errors that appear to be routine appear to me to not be ""errors"" at all, but designed to be subtle trampling of rights. Why are they so afraid of a fair trial? They will bend and/or break their own rules to avoid it. My letter telling them they were wrong in denying a Trial De Novo based on the 20-day time rule was a perfect example.

My current open case where they wanted to ignore the citation and hold an appearance at a random court of THEIR choosing without giving me reasonable notification or communication and response, is another great example. Why are they so afraid of going by the book?

Also, the fine revenue is more than a drop in the bucket. Remember, the fine isn't the only part of the citation. In CA, you pay more in fees and penalties than the original fine. They do this to avoid challenges to another right, and that is Cruel and Unusual Punishment. By not calling it a ""fine"" apparently the State thinks it's not a punishment.","
I think you guys missed the point of my long post. All those examples were things that didn't involve speed! Unless you consider a right turn at 1 MPH speed on a red light.

My point is that most, if not all, of your stories involved you getting pulled over for speeding. That is until you said most of your tickets were not for speeding and I called you on it.

Yes, and you were proven wrong and mistaken on that point.","

That's not true. I have these things called eyeballs, two of them, and they work great. I also have superior powers of observation while I""m driving. I'd have noticed an unsafe lane change, not using signals, or cell phone use in many cases, if they had occurred. Expires plates, I'm not paying attention for that, as it doesn't affect my safety. How would the Officer know that from their typical hidden positions? License plate readers? Would they pull someone over for only that reason without being certain their records are not faulty? Seems very far-fetched.

I think we all know all those other reasons are a mere statistical blip on what is usually going on out there.","

I dealt with serious data for a time as part of the work to which I was assigned. We did not have to fudge data, ignore data parts, to make any conclusions from that data. We didn't handpick or modify data records, nor did we select certain periods of time, as was/is done with the global warming hopeful.

The idea of global warming as a cause for certain folks to tax or sell is transparently a political purpose. Certain people have made millions maybe even billions already. We seldom have seen so many experts in the media with degrees in nothing, especially not in sciences which study and track the earth, as have been held up by the media. People with broadcasting school certificates as meteorologists are experts in the whom earth's behavior.

I parallel it (trigger alert) to the way many people stereotype GM products automatically (based on some deserved reputations in some models in the past).

I am surprised someone wanted to bring up this touchy topic. But the media makes it work with the populist method of putting out information for the people to believe that is being used these days. I believe more important is the 11-year sunspot cycle and a volcano erupting to warming and cooling.

Some data says the earth has been slowly cooling for a few years overall. There will be hot spots setting records every day. There will be cold spots setting records every day. There will be Lynchburgs with flooding potential due to heavy rainfall setting records every day. There is always an extreme being set somewhere, somehow. Macht nichts.","I get a laugh out of people thinking humans have that much control over the earth.

Also, IMO the EPA stuff (car emissions, coal burning, etc) issue got hijacked into global warming. That really generated from a much more basic problem of pollution at the ground level. Which really is a lot more relevant to people right now. Look at China, India, etc. That is a people issue (burning lots of crap polluting the environment and fouling air/water). Even if it does not materially change the climate long term, cleaning that stuff up will save lives (and parts of the planet).

Dino, you touch on a common theme. People like things the way they are, and don't want change. Ignoring that before them, things were different. So they don't care if 200 years ago a coastline was 1 mile further out to sea. They just don't want it to move inland 1 inch in their lifetime. When in reality, land has always been evolving, so if low lying coastal areas are going to flood, move elsewhere instead of trying to stop the ocean from doing what oceans do!

Throughout history, politicians and fear mongers talk and predict calamity. And in the end, people just adapt. Grow oranges in Canada if that is what needs to happen.","With the heat wave that has affected the Northeast for the last 10 days or so there are the usual dire proclamations on social media and citing of weather records. My favorite was one that was along the lines of ""Still denying climate change? The hottest week according to weather statistics since 1984!!!"" The obvious question was, of course, what happened back in 1984 then, before anyone knew about climate change?

Nope not trolling you. Just trying to look at this without all the hype and fear mongering that goes along with it. The fact of the matter is is that ever since the earth formed the climate has been in a constant state of flux. Sometimes changing faster sometimes slower but always changing. There are various reasons for the changes but it is a consistent change. To look at climate change as if the climate is static and any change is of human origin is disingenuous.

As much as I travel, I spend a lot of time in the airport Brookstones. Trying to remember, but I think I ended up buying a piece of carryon rollaboard luggage there to replace one that had just busted its wheels and handle. That was probably about 3 years ago and I still use their luggage. Matter of fact, I quite like it.

Sometimes I would stop in for a connector that I either lost or broke. I think I have one of their airline pillows.

That’s about it.

Not surprising they’re going out of business. With the amount of stores, expecially in airports, that sell the same stuff they did, they long gave up the category they had almost entirely to themselves.

For awhile there, they even were the only place to buy Temperpedic mastresses (now those matresses can be bought everywhere). And, the massage chairs can be had elsewhere, too. Just saw a display for those at Costco.

Sad to seen them go. I guess that lifetime warranty on the luggage is now null and void, too.","I bought an air purifier for my bedroom at Brookstone about 4 years ago.

We know that air and water pollution negatively affect animal, plant, sealife and human life - to a greater or lesser degree - still to be determined.  So why not at least “continue” to reduce carbon emissions and pollution of our planet that are controllable?  In Beijing, they wear face masks because the air pollution is so intense.

I think the ""denial"" reaction comes from highly suspicious and political way it was all introduced. The first documents were full of materially incorrect statements that seem to all be going ""one way"". Then data that could introduce any doubt was systematically scrubbed from subsequent documents (e.g. Medieval warming period). I'm in the skeptic camp myself, but not a complete denier. This is my position:

1. I don't doubt the climate is changing faster than before. It's always been changing, but now it may be changing faster than before.
2. It is likely that human contribution is a significant factor, but I'm not completely convinced human contribution is decisive factor.
3. The ""Earth is dying"" thesis, or similar catastrophic visions are complete BS, IMHO. Things will change, for many to worse, but we are not going to go extinct, or some garbage like that.
4. For humans, it's more of economic factor, not existential. We should debate how to adapt, not how to stop it. We should look at opportunities (northern climate agriculture, northern passage for shipping) as much as threats (sea water rise displacing large number of people). We should develop technologies coping with some effects (e.g. make desalination cheaper and more practical).
5. Attempts to stop the process are unrealistic, futile and frankly stupid. They are politically motivated by busy body types who will latch to any opportunity to take control over other peoples' lives,cause it's what they live for. Corporations, initially resisting the legislation, joined it on the premise of extra business for themselves. Infamous now are those CFL bulbs with highly toxic filaments, that didn't fix anything, but were shoved down peoples' throats, just to be supplanted by LED bulbs (the issue is much more complex). Another such glaring example is dieselgate by VW - classic attempt to ""save the planet"" by giving everybody cancer through nitrogen oxides. The electric/hybrid vehicles are not ""saints"" either - we will yet to see devastation caused by lithium extraction or storage of highly toxic spent batteries in the future.
6. All of that sums up to conclusion we know something, we don't know whole lot more and political decisions based on this information have potential to do more harm than good. People who are in charge and try to peddle some of ""solutions"" are not trustworthy, their motivation is less than pure.","EPA rollbacks are going to hurt the EV industry and give China a very competitive edge on us.

I'm surprised it took you this long. Plain and simple, the guy is just unlucky that he seems to find the most inappropriate times and places to speed. You can't have a logical discussion with an unlucky person. I stopped doing that months ago.

My experience is that the traffic courts tend to be somewhat fair and impartial. But then again I take responsibility for my actions. As for financial missions, most jurisdictions don't make money on traffic enforcement.

I have only one experience in traffic court.

This was when we moved to SC in March of 1992. Immediately after moving there I found a builder and he warned me about driving on Martinstown Rd in North Augusta SC (across the river from Augusta GA) . He had gotten several tickets on this well known to locals speed trap road. I just got off of I20 (55 MPH limit) on my way to see a place about something for the house when I was pulled over for speeding. The cop didn't want to hear my plea that I wasn't speeding so I shut up and decided to fight it in traffic court. That was an experience almost worth getting a ticket for. The magistrate allowed everyone ahead of us to plead their case (had to be at least 8 or 9 people) but in the end his gavel came down and he announced, ""the state of SC finds you guilty of speeding as charged (going xxx miles over the posted speed limit, pay $xxx fine and the number of points to be assessed) to the clerk on your way out"". He said this to EVERYONE, without exception, ahead of us. After hearing this 5 or 6 times I knew I was doomed and at one point Mrs. j leaned over and whispered, ""you know you are going to have the ticket upheld so why bother""? I told her since I was already there I might as well get my swing in.

Finally, it's my turn and I rose and told the magistrate the cop had to have captured the speed of a car that was passing me and I went on to tell him I had my car for about 10 years and had a very good feel for how fast my car was going at just about any speed and it was impossible that I was going 57 MPH in a 40 MPH zone. The magistrate politely listened like he did for all that came ahead of me, then he asked Mrs. j to stand and give her account of what happened. She confirmed what I said about a car passing me. He then asked the cop in the back of the room if he saw a car passing me. The cop said he didn't. The magistrate said, ""you know, I have a car that is about 7 years old and I know what you mean about having a feel for how fast you are going when you've had a car that long"". He scratches his head and asked, ""do you think you could have been going 5 MPH over the speed limit""? I said, ""5 was possible but not..."" that's when he cut me off and slammed his gavel down saying, ""the state of SC finds you guilty of going 45 MPH in a 40 MPH zone. Pay the clerk $45 on your way out and no points will be assessed"". I was stunned, to say the least. I still can't understand how that happened.

When I told my builder what happened he couldn't figure it out either other than to say, ""maybe she (pointing to Mrs. j) should go with me the next time I get a ticket on that road"".

Other potentially arguable comments aside, I found the above interesting because yesterday our municipal govt released its ""sunshine list"" - an increasingly common practice up here requiring govts and public institutions to list the names and compensation of all employees making over $100K annually.

In this town about 25% of all municipal employees are on the list. By far the biggest number are police constables and firemen (not captains or the like, just regular ones). It does not seem like it is just long-serving ones either as a few have already been identified as relatively new. Apparently overtime is easy to collect and quite lucrative. So much for the days when being a cop or a firefighter was an honorable but not excessively rewarding occupation.","
So very true! As most people only ever have contact with law enforcement through traffic stops, credibility here is critical to maintaining the public's trust.","@ab348, I for one do not begrudge policemen or firemen that type of salary. Theirs is a thankless job and certainly not one I would do for that salary. Yes, there are a few bad apples in the police ranks, but the vast majority are good brave folk. Even those that give @andres3 tickets (maybe especially those ones). I'll gladly pay the taxes necessary to keep top level people in those jobs.",Brookstone filed for bankruptcy and will close all its mall stores. Has anyone here even gone into a Brookstone in the past few years? Will any of you miss them? I can't recall ever buying anything from them. All I ever saw in there were freeloaders lounging in the massage chairs.,"
Hah! Yes, that is the truth! The firefighters (again, the rank and file, not the top brass) at my organization are among the highest paid staff. Their ""base salary"" is quite modest, but the actual amount of salary they receive per year is close to double that. Our police are not even in the same wheelhouse. They receive solid compensation, but nothing like the firefighters.","
Nope. Today I learned two things: (1) that people still go to the mall (/sarcasm), and (2) Brookstone still had stores in the mall!","
They seem to me to be badly overpaid, and I do acknowledge the risky and sometimes unpleasant nature of the job. But here, our cost of living is pretty low by comparison to larger places, the crime rate is low and mostly non-violent stuff, and by far the biggest chore for the fire service is a protocol that makes them, not police, the first responder to every traffic accident no matter how small. In short most days are filled with mundane tasks. When a fire or police captain (not eligible for OT) makes $120K and a regular firefighter or constable makes $115K, something is broken.","
I liked going into Brookstones and looking at all the cool gadgets. Never actually bought anything though.","Given what the firefighters and police have done here in Calif wildfires and debris flows the last few years, we can’t possibly compensate them enough for the dangerous jobs they do. Two firefighters lost their lives so far in the Yosemite fires, and one last year near me in the Thomas fire. They are generally fighting these fires in very hot conditions too. And the rescues in the Montecito debris flow were beyond heroic.","Right, there's no active enforcement. It's funny that in practice, the authorities seem more than happy to tolerate crosswalk crowding, wrong lane-turning, no signal use, distracted driving, etc than tolerating someone committing the crime against humanity of going 71 in a 60. Almost like one is much easier to enforce, and that's where it stops.
","My anecdotal experience just goes in the face of the flowery claims made of thousands of tickets issued after there's a ""campaign"" against any random issue (phone usage, left lane camping) but nobody ever seems to know anyone who received such a ticket. Maybe a speeding ticket is less embarrassing than a lane discipline ticket.


","Not to mention if American products are made to dumbed down standards, they will be even less competitive on the global market.

I am waiting for airbags and seatbelts to be removed from the list of requirements. The savings will trickle down to the consumer.
","And just wait for the expenses paid out once one hangs 'em up. That might be a bigger issue than salaries alone, but that one won't be touched, even as private sector workers are facing an ever-rougher road as they reach the same point in their lives. It's going to be a subject of harsh debate and protest, eventually.
","a lot of departments have moved to fewer employees but more OT. Must make sense in the long run. Save on benefits and pension costs.

and yes, for all the public unions the Pension (and retiree medical) is the 3rd rail. That must have been easy for politicians to give up in contract negotiations, but years of being overly generous is coming home to roost. I know for teachers and local police, newer hires have less generous plans. I think newbie cops now have to work 30 years instead of 20 to max out around here.","
Here the pension is indeed very generous. Eligibility is based on the rule of 80 for non emergency personal and 75 for public safety personal (age + years of service). The annual pension amount is calculated on the average of their best (highest salary) 3 years, and then the pension amount is 2%* # years of service, for life with indexing if the plan is solvent.","

Lesson learned: Don't talk about the Sebring!","
Great car.....I always liked those LeBarons. If they used that design today it would still be a sharp looking car.","
You're not supposed to drink the stuff!","The first motion was a change of venue based on CA vehicle code where it was requested at the time of the citation, but was not granted by the officer. In contention (perhaps, as the Officer nor DA showed up to oppose me), was that I most definitely worked closer to the County Seat than the assigned Court. The VC does say you have to live or work closer to ""demand"" the County Seat. I used a business card and my sworn under oath and penalty of perjury testimony that indeed my place of work was closer to the County Seat (geographically wasn't even close, so a map was not needed in my opinion), so it should clearly be granted if we are to follow the law. She said something riduclous to the effect of ""I hadn't established to the court's satisfaction I worked closer to the County Seat."" I was flabbergasted, as I was UNOPPOSED! the People were not represented, other than by this judge that seemed to take on the role of prosecutor instead of judge! This is the SAME EXACT motion granted to my lawyer a few months ago. Only difference there was that the Officer did grant the County Seat, and a Court adminisitrative error placed it in the wrong Court. Their is PUBLISHED case law for the County Seat VC to be adhered to, so my case was highly appealable since I was later found guilty and my rightful motion was improperly and incorrectly denied. That would be solid grounds to overthrow the case. The People's only argument to oppose that would be to argue that the ""error"" didn't prejudice my case substantially (which I know it did, but the Court might not accept or like the reasons why). I should have appealed the decision based on the faulty motion denial, but I didn't. Would have cost some serious time and money. Lawyers don't like to waste thier political capital on stuff like this. They'd probably upset the judge who's ruling got appealed, and they make more money on the sheer numbers of cases they take in traffic court.

The second motion was for ""compelling discovery"" since my informal and properly issued Discovery Request for documents was ignored by the City, the DA, and the law enforcement agency involved (Sheriffs).

Two pretty basic motions that had nothing to do with one another. I had a similar motion to the second one previously granted at the County Seat for another case. These motions come straight out of the NOLO PRESS David Brown books. They are nothing extraordinary.

The judge in Ventura didn't like all the points of my defense, which included mentioning I had a radar detector that indicated to my vehicle wasn't the one that was ""radared."" He also probably didn't like that I made the officer show twice, since on the first trial date they had not responded to my discovery request, in in response to my motion to compel discovery, they suddenly produced the requested items right then and there that day at trial. This is why I now insist on a motion hearing BEFORE trial date.

Anyway, I was given a choice to review the documents right then and there and have my trial a half hour or 2 later (as needed), or a continuance. Since the Officer had showed up, I went with continuance. I think my motion plus a thorough defense and cross examination (since he showed up again!) bothered the judged enough that he let it show. There's no real good defense for 97 MPH, but I brought up every plausible reasonable doubt from tire inflation to radar errors. The detector worked fine for other CHP radar, I have never been given to this date any reason to think it malfunctioned the one time it mattered. I may have been speeding, but I believe his 97 radar reading was spurious error or made-up. He also stated he estimated my speed before activating the radar, which must of been for quite a spectacular range of distance given we were headed in opposite directions. I got him to admit he couldn't tell what brand/model of car I was driving at that distance, but somehow the court believes his speed estimate is accurate anyway? I wasn't any good at the timeline defense back then, but if this happened again, I'd try to get the officer to testify to a timeline of events, and then use speed math to show that the positions of our vehicles throughout the timeline may not line up with his story.","















It does surprise me as I cannot remember you posting anything about those citations, just getting busted for speeding. Maybe you could link one of your previous posts talking about one of those ""gotcha"" citations.

Let's see. The last ticket I was convicted for was a ""Stop Sign"" violation. Yes, the intersection near my home where I believe in 1,000 visits to this stop sign, I've never encountered a crossing car that needed to be yieilded to first. Talk about high traffic and high hazard! I probably rolled through at less than 3 MPH, and sight lines are amazing. He wasn't on the ""travel"" portion of roadway, but hidden in a parking spot along the residential street; behind a parked car.

I recall my story of my only ""not guilty"" verdict. Was a trial by declaration too. VC cited for was ""Passing on the Right Shoulder."" I successfully argued either 1) the lane wasn't a shoulder but the right-most lane of travel, and/or 2) even if it was a shoulder, I didn't pass anyone.

He didn't explain if he bought both arguments, but I only needed to convince him of one of those elements, and a not guilty verdict results.

I received my only tailgating ticket ever when I was still in college. That one was funny, as I remember it being possibly the worst ""cut-off"" in my entire life. Unsafe lane change was the correct violation to issue, for the guy in front of me!

I have at least 3 incidences of being ticketed for ""running a red light"" when really what happened was an argument over whether I came to a complete stop for a right turn on red. My first ticket ever at 16 or 17 was for running a red light that was still yellow (I legally had entered that intersection! AT least that one was a left turn).

I was wrongly accused of using the exit lanes as a passing lane on the freeway. In fact, I had just gotten onto the freeway, and was merging for the first time. I can only imagine that my Accord was mistaken identity. Don't remember what VC that was.

Front license plate missing fix-it tickets.

""Sign Violation"" VC cited for a U-turn I made where there happened to be a No-U-Turn Sign in one spot I didn't see. No one had to slow down or brake for my maneuver, but the generic VC for a ""sign violation"" cares not.

Bald tires ""fix it"" ticket - that one is part of the U-turn just above, where the officer got mad I noted on the ticket he refused the county seat, so he added this 2nd violation after I had already signed the ticket. I was found guilty on the sign violation at trial, not guilty on the bald tires, so I guess that makes 2 not guilty verdicts. Funny, since it was 1 count guilty 1 count not guilty I view that as a loss and didn't remember the win. Come to think of it, if you read my post above, that's the main reason I probably didn't appeal the decision, it was only half a loss.","I think what my ticket stories above show is that law enforcement is pretty incompetent and inept when they try to enforce anything other than speed laws. They are very experienced and therefore, more competent with the speeding tickets. On my ""maximum"" speed violations, they for the most part have the upper hand, and were correct that I was speeding per the letter of the law. Basic speed law is different, and gives me a fighting chance.","And yet here you are, fighting the tickets. Sounds like they are pretty competent to me, you’re just unhappy. ","
You call a 55% conviction rate ""pretty competent"" ?","Example for speed trial cross-examination:

How far away was I when you estimated my speed? 2,000 feet?

How far away was I when you got/locked-in your radar reading?

What procedures do you go through to take a radar reading (push button, turn dial, whatever)

HOw long do those procedures take?

Did you use your radio?

Activate your lights and sirens?

How long does that take?

With questions like this you might just be able to show that his estimates are hogwash. Or the Officer might testify he instantaneously did 10 things all within a second, which seems overly confident to me. You may be able to show that at the speeds he testifies you were going, the ranges he testifies to are not accurate at all for the timeline given.",I’m letting this go. No sense engaging. ,"

It's become all too routine and that's not necessarily a good thing. Men should explore all avenues of treatment before merely acquiescing to the knife, when it comes to the prostate. The aftereffects are often not the least bit pleasant. Depending on the age when you are diagnosed, it is often much smarter to live with it, as it is usually a very slowly progressing disease. So diet, exercise and close monitoring can give you your same natural life span as drastic surgical techniques.","

Definitely not. I was on a 2 lane stretch of I-75, and I had followed these 2 flatbed transport trucks for about 20 minutes....one trying to pass the other. They had chains and steel loaded on the back like it could fly off at any time.....there were about 12 cars behind me all trying to get by.

Finally, finally, the truck in the passing lane gave up and fell back behind the right lane truck. Then I unleashed the horses in the 535 just to break ahead, break up the chain behind me, get ahead of the two wackos in the trucks with loose loads, and there was snooper trooper hiding in the bushes.

That's true in some cases, but you need to understand exactly how aggressive the cancer is before you decide on treatment - the Gleason scale is used. The higher the Gleason score, the more aggressive the cancer. If you just watch a Gleason score 9 cancer that has spread outside the prostate, you could be dead in two years. Yes, the after effects of surgery can be a booger bear, but in some cases, you really don't have a choice as to surgery. Self-education on the subject and not just blindly following the doctor is the best course.","
Speaking of scams on Craigslist...

I lost my yellow lab to lymphoma about a month ago, and I have been looking around for another dog as a companion to my remaining dog. I usually prefer to rescue an adult dog, and 2 of the last 3 have came from Craigslist. The exception, the one I still have, was a volunteer. I opened the front door one morning and she just waltzed in. Seven years later, she's still here, what can I say?

The yellow lab I just lost, she was from Craigslist. The guy had lost his job, they were foreclosing on his home, he, his wife, and his 2 kids were moving in with his brother, who rented, and no one had any money for a pet deposit. Very sad story, I even considered offering him the money for the pet deposit, but he wouldn't have been able to afford the other costs associated with pet ownership, so ...

Re: having become too routine. There's a doctor in NYC who advertises his radiation treatment center for cancer on an hour long radio program in the middle of the night. He gives advice essentially that no one needs surgery as treatment for most cancers, including prostate cancer. I feel that's dangerous. I've heard area advertisements that 5 radiation treatments and you're cured. Zip. Boom. Bam. Done.

I talked to a surgeon who had treated prostate and other cancers with radiation when it was a fad several years back and preferred over surgery. The cells stop growing but some don't die and go dormant. Then they come back to life later after years. From what I can tell they usually have metastasized when they are found again.

Like many other cancers, it is best if found early. Brother, uncle, etc., or female relatives with gynecological cancer? Start getting PSA tests as a baseline. Cheap, even if your insurance doesn't pay. Usually insurance will have a reduced rate with the lap which you may pay instead of the rack rate."

Oh not at all. But I've been in enough court rooms to see many different judges at work. In my earlier years, I actually enjoyed watching 10 trials after my own, and seeing 10 straight guilty verdicts. I've seen and experienced enough judges that I can tell the difference. The worst one I've ran into was in El Cajon at a Motion Hearing. My second motion got no consideration. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Apparently my appearance as a Defendant Pro Se was offensive enough to have the first one denied, and on the basis of that, even though my 2nd motion had nothing to do with the first, was denied too!

Another judge in Ventura left a sour impression. He seemed to be annoyed that I had to be punished for 97 MPH rather than 100 MPH. Deep down that guy wished I had been going 100 so he could really sock it to me, and bend me over.
OK for your second motion not having consideration I really would like to have seen your first motion. No offense (although you may take offense if you so desire) you seem to be the type of person who would throw a lot of legalize out in hope that something would stick. A lot of judges don't like that and will shut it down. So without seeing your first motion I really cannot comment.

As for the judge being annoyed, did he ""seem"" annoyed or was he actually annoyed. Big difference. An what was he really annoyed about. Last time I was on a court the judge was annoyed but it was against the prosecution not the defendan who just happened to be my son. The judge told the prosecutor that in now way my son should have been in his courtroom and dismissed the case. ","andres3 said:

Most tax prep software will allow you to download tax forms like 1099's. Most will allow you to split it and see what it would be if you filed separately. If not you could do them both separately to see what the result is. 98% of the time filing jointly is best.","andres3 said:]

I do think that Harley needs smaller less expensive bikes to compete with the likes of say a Honda Shadow 250. This would help bring in the younger bikers without a lot of money to spend and hopefully get their brand loyalty. Right now Harley seems to be attracting more middle aged adults looking at the image.

As for new vs used a lot of bikes are used mostly for weekend rides and then just a few weekends in the summer. So it's not unusual to be able to find a 5 year old bike with less than 10k on the clock. Mine was 3 years old with about 7k on it when i bought it. Outfitted the way it was i saved at least 35% off the MSRP brand new.

As for buying used i would be careful about Harleys. Not because they are bad bikes, they are pretty good, but because owners tend to do modifications on them some of which may harm the bike and some you may want to undo. 

Electric bikes are up and coming and you should start seeing more on the road, but i want a lot more range.

One thing that needs to be done across manufacturer lines is start offering more transmission choices. Honda seems to be making the push for dual clutch transmissions (mine has the DCT). This could bring in new riders weary of shifting a bike and keep older riders starting to have mobility issues. ","You have to be careful here.

Just wait you'll get your chance.","There were several posts recently about credit scores.  I have a little more info re: scores.

There are 3 credit bureaus in the US that develop a “score” for mortgage and auto finance companies as well as credit card issuers and insurance companies.  The 3 are TransUnion, Experian and Equifax.  Financial scores are either FICO scores or Vantage scores..  Vantage is the newest score developed by all three credit reporting agencies.

Most often, your Vantage score is within 5-10 points of your FICO score.  Scores from each of the bureaus can vary as much as 10-15 points of each other.

Scores of 790-850 are considered excellent.  720-789 are considered good.  These ranges vary slightly between Vantage and FICO score calculations.

I carry 4 credit cards and 1 Debit Card.  Each of my credit card issuers provide monthly updates on either your FICO score or your Vantage score - not both.

I appreciate your trying to be helpful but in my case not very much. Let me explain.

I told about my experience with credit scores when we bought the '15 Genny in June of '15. The salesman comes back to the table and says, ""good news, you guys qualify for Hyundai's 0.9% financing for 60 months"". He didn't have to say that because I knew we had a good credit scores but since he mentioned it I asked what it was. He says, ""I have Mrs. jmonroe's credit report right here but I forgot to get a copy of yours"". So I asked what hers was and he said, ""883 out of a possible 900 which like I said is very good but I'll have to get you yours but I think it was 6 or 7 points lower than hers"". I looked over at Mrs. j and she had a smug look on her face that I have seen before. In the confusion of getting all the paper work signed I forgot to ask again for my printed credit report. So, as far as I'm concerned (playing mind games like @driver100 likes to do about seeing celebrities) the salesman could have been wrong and my score could have been at least as good as Mrs. j's, maybe even a little better but without proof I can't win that argument.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago when we were on the ""how do I get my credit score from my credit card company"" subject, our poster buddy @dino001 told me how to get mine from BA since he had a card with them also. When I went online to sign up it only had a spot for entering one Social Security number so I entered mine. Over all the months when I've checked it, when BA notified me via email that my bill could be viewed online, I used that opportunity to click on my credit score. It has varied a couple points or two but for about the last year it was stuck on 839 out of 850. When the online statement for July showed up, it now showed 845. Mrs. j was in the office watching TV when I saw my new number and I yelled out, ""YIPPEE, it's about time"". Just a little explanation here, she knows that the BA credit score is my score because of what I said above. OK, now that you guys know that, she says, ""yippee what""? So I told her I'm getting there and it won't be long before I have a perfect 850 out of 850 (like @dino001 was bragging about the other day). She said, ""if you used my Social Security number it would have been perfect for years now"". I've already showed her that she can't just add 6 or 7 points onto my score to indicate what hers would be because the scale is different but she conveniently forgets about that math. And when I cautiously remind her of it (to avoid another lap or two around the dining room table) she says, ""if yours can go up so can mine so mine has to be perfect by now"".

That is what I mean about being treated like Roger Dangerfield. Before anyone in here jumps me that I mean Rodney not Roger, I've already explained, Rodney gets no respect from his wife, whereas Roger's wife tortures him. On good days I am treated like Rodney but most of the time like Roger.

As you can see, even Federals Appeals Courts (high level) are routinely corrected by the SCOTUS. Sometimes even SCOTUS makes unanimous 9-0 decisions, which makes you wonder why it had to be taken that high in the first place!

In fact, nothing unsafe of any kind. Technical violations at times, yes, sometimes, they just plain got it wrong.","

The surgery chargers were under $100 for the surgeon, 3 anesthesiologist charges along with real time lab testing of the blood level of the parathyroid hormone during surgery. All that for 5.5 hours in hospital for a 3 hour planned surgery. We have NOT gotten a hospital bill. I'm betting we don't get one for the hospital itself since it's been 3 months.

I have another one, Shifty.  I remember this vividly - one of the few things I do remember from my early boyhood.  On a Tuesday night when I was 8 years old, my brother and I were awakened by our parents at 9:30 PM (on school nights we were in bed by 8:00 PM) and were told we were going with my grandpa to Miami that night on an Eastern Airlines Super G Constellation.  They had packed our things while we were at school that day.  My Mom’s parents lived in Coral Gables (Miami) at the time and grandpa was in New York on a business trip.

My grandpa took us to Idlewild Airport (forerunner of JFK Airport) and we boarded the plane.  I remember that our departure was delayed a bit (scheduled for 12:00 midnight) as we were waiting for a passenger to arrive.  Back then, Night Flights were less expensive than day flights.  We finally took off and during the 4-1/2 hour flight, grandpa took us back to the tail section of the plane which was a lounge in those days.  As we entered the lounge, Milton Berle was sitting there smoking his cigar and drinking a cocktail.  He shook our hands and gave us each an autographed picture of himself 

For those of you old enough to remember his weekly TV program, he was aired live from New York every Tuesday night at 9:00 PM.  So he was late for the flight because of the long drive from Manhattan to Idlewild - no interstates back then.  Very exciting for both me and my brother.  

Mike, that is a very cool story. Milton Berle was one of the real giants of comedy and a pioneer of television. What a great memory for you!","

This reminds me of an incident from around 1987 or so when I was invited to spend a week with my college buddy and his lovely wife, who were living at the time in Scarborough, Ontario. If you've ever been there you know it is suburbia on steroids, and the part where they lived was in a development of townhouses, hundreds or thousands of them, on typical winding suburban streets with no defining natural features. The housing units themselves were even all the same colors.

I had driven to Ontario and was there all week eating their food and drinking their booze, so a day or so before I was supposed to leave I decided to restock their fridge as thanks. I took my car to the supermarket and beer store, bought a bunch of stuff, and headed back. The way I had always identified their house was by seeing their second car parked in the driveway, an old white Chevette. I saw it, got out with my purchases, and walked in the unlocked front door of the house. I put the grocery bags down in the hall and was about to go back outside to get the case of beer when I looked up and realized I was in the wrong house. I saw or heard nobody so I picked up the bags, went outside onto the stoop and looked around. About 6-8 houses up was another white Chevette parked in a driveway. I quickly put all the stuff back in my car and drove up there. Fortunately this time I found the right place.","

Idyllwild is a resort town about 6000-7000 feet above the desert floor and Palm Springs.  It’s on Mt. San Jacinto.  Been there many times during the summers for weekend get-aways from the desert heat.  Up there temps average in the mid 70’s.  We also used to go up to Lake Arrowhead, CA (7000-8000 feet above San Bernardino) where we would rent a cabin for a week.  Temps up there in summer were 70-75 degrees.

Our town is suburban trending to urban and the road is well marked. At the end of our long driveway our name and number are on the mailbox in 6 inch letters. Hard to miss.

I go to the head of the stairs an see a middle age woman standing there who had just walked in to my house. I said ""who the heck are you?"" And she said something about looking for her cousin and ""maybe"" she was in the wrong house. I said "" so you're not sure of the house and you just walk in?""

It really gripes me that many feel the need to accelerate briskly up the street at 40 mph or more just because it is a slight hill/incline. It isn't like its Powers Run Rd that's near Pittsburgh that is very steep and about 3/4 mile long and no houses on either side!

I have another one, Shifty.  I remember this vividly - one of the few things I do remember from my early boyhood.  On a Tuesday night when I was 8 years old, my brother and I were awakened by our parents at 9:30 PM (on school nights we were in bed by 8:00 PM) and were told we were going with my grandpa to Miami that night on an Eastern Airlines Super G Constellation.  They had packed our things while we were at school that day.  My Mom’s parents lived in Coral Gables (Miami) at the time and grandpa was in New York on a business trip.

My grandpa took us to Idlewild Airport (forerunner of JFK Airport) and we boarded the plane.  I remember that our departure was delayed a bit (scheduled for 12:00 midnight) as we were waiting for a passenger to arrive.  Back then, Night Flights were less expensive than day flights.  We finally took off and during the 4-1/2 hour flight, grandpa took us back to the tail section of the plane which was a lounge in those days.  As we entered the lounge, Milton Berle was sitting there smoking his cigar and drinking a cocktail.  He shook our hands and gave us each an autographed picture of himself 

For those of you old enough to remember his weekly TV program, he was aired live from New York every Tuesday night at 9:00 PM.  So he was late for the flight because of the long drive from Manhattan to Idlewild - no interstates back then.  Very exciting for both me and my brother.  "

Earlier this week I read a piece in the L.A. Times about a new book by ex-Dodger Ron Fairly. It contained a story about Drysdale that made me laugh:

""Once in Chicago, Drysdale was drinking all night with Cubs infielder Don Zimmer, a former teammate. Before the next day’s game, Zimmer told his teammates that Drysdale, who was the Dodgers’ starting pitcher, was surely still drunk.

Drysdale, a 6-foot-6 bear of a man who was feeling fine, heard about what Zimmer was saying and decided to milk it. When the Cubs came to bat in the bottom of the first, Drysdale acted like he couldn’t see catcher John Roseboro, who was in on the joke.

Roseboro stood and shouted, “Over here!’’ to Drysdale, who promptly threw his first pitch over the batter’s head and to the backstop.

From the Cubs’ dugout, Drysdale heard frightened players muttering that he was, indeed, drunk. Nobody wanted to bat. Ron Santo came to the plate and shouted, “Hey Don, can you see me?’’

Drysdale knocked a few guys down before throwing a complete-game victory and striking out 10. After, he invited Zimmer to dinner again. Zimmer refused.""

In the early '70s Drysdale worked Montreal Expos games in his first job as a color commentator on their national CBC-TV broadcasts. He was very good at it and later moved to a similar role with ABC in the US.","Koufax and Drysdale take me back to being a kid.

Well spending the last few days here in Orlando with the grandkids. Almost pulled the trigger and bought a house. It was at one of the larger 55+ communities which had several villa homes which they used for putting up visitors who would come in for a couple of days to try out the community. These were fully finished 2 bedrooms with a study for $190k sitting on a lake. These were great boys (5 of the 8 were sold in less than a week). We were thinking of using it as a rental until we were ready to retire then move into it when we retire in 8 to 10 years.

For various reasons we pulled the plug on it right after we were approved for the loan. But the search goes on. 
You don’t really want a home on a lakefront property here in Florida - alligators, iguanas, snakes, flooding, to name a few reasons.  Orlando is nice, but the traffic on I-4 and feeder roads and streets can be miserable due to all the attractions.

You might want to consider the Jacksonville area.  You get cooler temps in winter (40-50 at night) and daytime temps are comfy (65-75).  Lots of new development south and west of Jacksonville.","suydam said:
I was in Palm Desert in June. As long as you’re a night owl or like the indoors it’s fine. From 8 in the morning till at least 9 at night the heat is unbearable. I grew up in a different California desert and I would never go back! I need WATER!
You are 100% right, suydam.  June through October is brutal in the Coachella Valley.  This past week my son called to tell me it hit 120 degrees in the shade.  This is a departure from average daytime temps of 104-108 F.  Yes, it’s dry like an oven, but 108-120 F is murder.

The Low Desert is great to live in from November through May.  The High Desert (Las Vegas) is brutal in summer and cold in winter.

Northern Florida has a great climate - but still hot and humid in summer.  Many Palm Desert area residents have summer homes in the San Diego area or Laguna Beach where it’s cooler because of the cold Pacific Ocean.

Actually, I could not afford to live out there.  Average monthly rentals are $1200-$2000 a month.  Sales taxes are 8%-8.5% on everything.  Gasoline is 1 dollar more a gallon than here.  State income taxes are brutal.  Summers are brutal.  I would need to have spendable income at $100,000 a year or more, which is way more than my monthly income now.  Even annual car registration is over $1000 for my car.  Utilities are high.

I agree I should be nearer to my family but I just can’t right now.  My son earns over $90,000 a year and barely makes it each month.","My brush with a celebrity.....

I fly a lot, mostly with Delta, which I have 2 million miles logged.

Anyway, they used to upgrade me fairly regularly to first class given my “status”. That doesn’t happen much any more as they’d rather leave a first class seat empty rather than have to spend an extra $20 for a couple of beers and crappy food that I would cost them.

Anyway, I flew quite often to CA from Cincinnati. Delta had a hub here at the time. So, it was a connecting point from flights coming from the East or the South.

Going to CA I got to my seat. Already sitting there was a guy who looked kind of familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on who he was. Normally I do work on those long flights (4 hours) and leave my seat mate alone. This guy started a conversation and asked about what I did, where I actually lived (Cincinnati), etc.

Finally, wheels up and the tiny screens dropped down to play the inflight movie. Movie had Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in it, so I was mildly interested in seeing it. The movie’s name was “Practical Magic”. The male lead comes on screen and looks a whole lot like the guy sitting next to me. I look at the screen, and then back at him a couple of times. He looks at me and says “yeah......I still can’t get used to seeing myself on any sort of screen”. It was Aiden Quinn. Cool guy. We talked the rest of the flight.

I had a similar experience on a non-stop flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Los Angeles on an American Airlines flight a few years back.  It was a Boeing 757 so the main entry to the plane was just behind first class.  I was upgraded to first class and my seat was just behind the bulkhead next to the window.  But when I got there after boarding, I saw the head of a man who was sitting in my seat.  I thought I should seek out the flight attendant so as not to create an uncomfortable discussion why he should move to his assigned seat.  So I went to the flight attendant and told her my problem.  She said to me, “...you must be Mr. Si....r.  Welcome aboard.  The gentleman in your seat asked me to give you this envelope.”  So I opened the envelope and there were 5 crisp new $100 bills in it with a note asking if I would mind sitting in the aisle seat.  It was signed “Marc Anthony”, the recording star.  I walked up to him, returned his $500 and said to him, “...can I buy a few hours of conversation from you?”  He smiled and said “sure”!",I once took a leak next to Troy Aikman's nephew's appliance repairperson.

Palm Desert is one of several cities in the Coachella Valley which include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Bermuda Dunes, Indian Wells, La Quinta and Indio.  Many Movie and TV stars and professional athletes own winter homes in Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells and La Quinta and a few in Palm Springs.  So during the winter, it is quite common to be seated in a restaurant and have a star or sports legend seated at the next table.

I also had a number of kids at the school I ran whose parents were pro athletes or TV/Movie stars.  I remember sitting next to Tim Conway and his wife at a restaurant in Rancho Mirage.  A few weeks later I was at a concert in Rancho Mirage and Tommy LaSorta was sitting right next to me.  It was quite common in the Coachella Valley to see stars walking on the street or at the movies or at restaurants.

I was very close with Don Drysdale and his wife (Annie Meyers Drysdale) and their kids.  I remember being at his funeral at Forest Lawn near Chavez Ravine.  At the memorial service, I was seated right next to Sandy Koufax.  My son sat next to Roosevelt Greer who took up 2 seats due to his size.  All the current and retired Dodgers were in attendance and the Emcee was Vin Scully. Very moving experience.

What I miss most about my years in Palm Desert is being with my son and my grandchildren.  But I also miss the laid back embiance of the Desert Cities and the non-challant pace of daily life among the stars intermingling in the lives of every-day people.

We sat down at the bar and ordered our drinks when this guy on my right told the bartender to put the drinks we ordered on his tab.  I looked at him and extended my hand to shake his hand to thank him for picking up our cocktails.  He said to me, “...anytime Steve, I didn’t know you were here for the convention...”!  I said to him that my name was Mike and that I was not here for a convention.  I further added that I hoped he would still pay for our drinks.  He said, “...stop kidding me, Steve, you’re always trying to be a comedian...”!  I’m not Steve I told him.  I pulled out my driver’s license to prove to him who I was.  After looking at my license and photo, he said I was the spitting image of one of his managing partners at his accounting firm.  I responded, “...you must mean my twin brother whose name is Steve.”

Good story @ab.

Back in the late 50's and early 60's my uncle knew a guy that helped put on a dinner and gathering of present and past sport celebrities (around a dozen or so) at a night club in my town to help raise money for a veterans group. He was always given several free tickets (don't know what the real cost was) and he and his oldest son along with my father and my middle brother and I heard at least two hours of stories like that.

Just a quick story that I remember told by Joe Garagiola (one time catcher in the majors with a few teams and even spent a couple years with the Pirates). Joe was not a very good hitter but he was a pretty good catcher, so I was told.

One time Joe came to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. He hit a double that scored two runs. If it wasn't for a slow poke who had to stop at third he would have had a bases clearing double. However, he was still very excited since he rarely got hits like that. Joe takes a big lead off second wanting to make sure he'll score if the guy at the plate gets a hit. Then because of his excitement he decides to steal third, forgetting that there is a guy on third. When Joe slides into third, the guy on third looks down and yells, ""Joe, where the hell are you going? Joe looked up and said, ""back to second if I can make it"". He didn't and that killed the inning.

Heard stories like that, one after another after another. Left that place with my sides hurting due to laughing. One more part of my life I'll never see again.

Baseball seems to generate more funny stories than any other sport. Maybe it is due to the slow pace of the game and the long 162-game season leading to lots of extended time on the road.

Girl: OH,OH,OH, your him. I can't believe it. Are you really him, really?

That would work.   The Uber would be about thirty miles. The only thing is Metropark goes north of where you are going. Only other station would be Cherry hill, but that would be closer to 70 Miles but I bet might be faster.   ","Ah, Ray Catena, huh? I have 2 sets of in-laws in Oakhurst.

Ouch! Poor Mrs. jmonroe - good thing she only bit into the top inside of her upper lip - could have been so much worse.

As for the ""how it happened"" learning lesson, I know exactly what caused it. Back when I was in graduate school, a bunch of the guys decided to play softball. I hit a grounder to the third baseman and as I was crossing over first base, I landed in such a way that my left knee dislocated. They took me to the hospital and they did an emergency procedure in the operating room to put my knee back into its natural state. Unfortunately for me, my left common peroneal nerve was severed at the knee joint causing me to lose motion and feeling on parts of my lower left leg and several toes as well as ankle movement. There was a ton of damage done to my ligaments, tendons and my patella. After 6 hours of surgery the following week and two more surgeries to repair the nerve, I went into rehab for a month.

I wore a lower leg brace conneted to my shoe with a spring-loaded mechanism so I would have a more natural walking gate. After many months of physical therapy, they decided that due to the severed nerve, I would develop a ""drop foot"" on my left leg. So, sometimes I trip on things like sidewalk cracks that are uneven or carpeting - come to think about it - just about everything. I just have to be careful with this limitation I have. So that's the long and the short of it (mostly long). I am paralyzed on my left foot - cannot raise the foot at all.","
Sorry to hear that, Mike. I hope you make a speedy recovery.

You are correct (as usual) about senior citizens falling frequently. My sense of balance is not what it used to be. Sometimes just walking down the street I will weave a little bit.

As for you braking your wrist twice, you are one ahead of me.

Skinned up both palms, both elbows and both knees along with having a very sore right wrist. When Mrs. j saw all the blood she got worried but while I was laying there on my back, I remember saying, ""it looks worse than it is but this wrist is going to hurt like a bit** tomorrow morning"". Because I could move it in all directions I didn't think it was broken. Then when we got back from vacation I decided to go to the emergency room because even though the swelling was almost gone, it was still sore. Sure enough an X-ray showed a break. Even the doctor didn't think it was broken because I could move it so well.

Home ownership is a secondary investment, not your main investment. The alternative to home ownership is renting. And even in the worst possible scenario you can piece together, such as the above, the homeowner still comes out ahead. Coming out ahead is good when you consider the poor guy who spent all those years renting, while still having to pay utilities, taxes, various home expenses and paying enough monthly rent for his landlord to pay all his expenses, taxes, home repairs and still make a profit. How far in the minus column is that poor guy after 10 or 20 years.
I actually disagree with the math. Nobody showed me a comprehensive calculation that includes all costs of home ownership and compares them with costs of renting. It's not there, because real estate industry would kill any suggestion the math may not be as great. Another reason is large number of variables, not conducive for general public to actually understand a multivariable calculation. It's usually couple of great sounding one-liners, like ""you lock in your payment, think how many times your landlord will raise the rent"", aimed at ending any in-depth discussion about the subject and going with the warm feelings. BTW, really poor guy will never get approved for any kind of decent mortgage in a decent house in a safe neighborhood. Not so poor guy will have enough to get a decent rental, save the rest and invest it on a side. For years we heard ""houses never lose value"". Well, they did big. Mine still didn't recover from its 2005 peak. 13 years later it's still worth below what people thought it was worth then. But even if its value rose by 50 or 75 percent in that time, I'd still maintain there were better ""investments"". I like my place, I'm not selling it and I'm not moving.

Xerox was excellent at training sales people. If you couldn’t succeed with their (constant) training, you should look for a different kind of work.

In the 3 years I was in sales with Xerox, I think I went back to classes at least once every 6 months. There was basic, advanced, strategic, enterprise and some other sales courses they taught me that I used to make me successful.

Any sales person who says you don’t have to know your product to be successful, isn’t a very good sales person. This is particularly true in high tech sales where potential customers need to get knuckle deep into the product to find a fit.

That’s what always shocked me about some car sales people. If you know more than your car sales person, it’s probably a fair guess that the sales person learns his/her products quickly, or that person will fail.

Establishing rapport and finding out needs is certainly important, too. But, even if you find out what your potential customer wants/needs, but don’t know your own product enough to find a fit, you’re not going to make the sale in all likelihood.

As much as I hated cold calling, I do miss the sales end of my previous jobs. Nothing feels better than to know you did a good job for your customer and they’re happy with you.....and knowing your company is going to reward you (well) for the good job you did.

Met a lot of different people, too.....some remain friends with me to this day. Some even call me to consult on other tech projects they find themselves involved in.

Apparently, the USA has the highest road death fatality rate in the industrialized world. On any given summer's day, about 100 Americans die in a car. You name it---texting, drunk drivers, or being a pedestrian hit by any of the above. Saturday is the most lethal day.

Interestingly, the death rate has been going down in some categories, but motorcyclists have not benefited at all from any safety regulations.

With some exceptions within the following age group, road crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 3 and 34 (as of 2014).","Good news on the newspaper front: I heard the newspaper hit the front door at 4:30 AM this morning.

Plus, why are you buying all these houses if it is smarter to rent?","The comments about credit scores made me go look at mine. 698. The last time I looked, a few months back, it was 783. Probably dropped because I financed that new truck. Which was only temporary anyway, just to get the $750 kick back from Ford Motor Credit. In 91 days, when I pay off the loan, will my credit score bounce back as fast as it went down? Don't know, don't care really.

One interesting note. I financed about $14k, and while I was doing the financial part, I was talking to the finance guy about when it was okay to pay it off. Still 90 days, just like before. Not that you have to wait that long, but they really appreciate it if you do. And I always try to treat people fairly, at least as long as they do the same.

So the interesting part, the finance guy says some people will pay the bulk of the loan at the first payment date, thus reducing the interest over the next two months. He assured me that would not be a problem for the dealership. I did a quick calculation, 6.9% on $14k, that’s about $80 a month in interest. Just something new (at least new to me).","100 point drop is huge, usually one new account is not enough to make such a dent. When I got mine, it dropped by 25 points or so for a few months, before it started climbing back.

Now it doesn't matter - you have your truck, just pay it and it will rise in time. No, it won't got up instantly on the payoff. BTW, 6.9% is ridiculously high, almost hard to believe it was a prime credit. The dealer must have marked it up by two or three percent. At this point, the credit score is the least of the worry.

A credit score totally ignores a person's net worth and cash flow. A z score over emphasizes current assets which means a company with high receivables and/or inventories is enhanced, when both of those situations are actually potential signs of a cash crisis.

I've never seen a formula or analysis on owning v renting that is comprehensive and realistic. On the buying side they tend to ignore the not insignificant costs of buying and selling a house in the calculations. They also tend to ignore the mathematics of a compound interest curve that often result in a 30 year mortgage costing 3X the original mortgage when held to maturity, or leading to an average 7 year house ownership life having payments that are mostly interest and little principal. On top of that, the tax deduction is nice (but now reduced for many) but still it really only saves (returns) your tax bracket percentage of your tax and interest payouts (eg. if you pay $10K in interest and taxes with a 20% tax bracket you have effectively reduced your taxes by $2K, not $10K). On the renting side, they tend to underestimate rents rising annually and the fact that as the landlord has increased taxes and maintenance they will pass most of it off to you through those rent increases. The pro renting side tends to rely on the ""investment"" of the upfront home purchase and down payment savings in stocks, bonds, etc. except many don't actually do that, while the pro buying side tends to rely on capital gains when you sell - both are ""potential"", not guaranteed. Seems to me that if you have a $2K monthly rent, over time you would have probably spent around half of that on average on home maintenance, repairs, taxes and the like if you owned a place, so your effective rent difference is more like $1K than the full $2K rent.

I find the field of artificial intelligence interesting. Basically, it appears to rely on developing computer algorithms often based on formula calculations. This is supposed to beat the human mind because it is ""impartial and not emotional"", except the algorithm and formula methods are developed by the human brain, so in fact cannot be totally objective either really. In investment, no edge tends to last very long because regardless of methodology Wall Street has always been notorious for herd mentality.

Now income inequality doesn't appear to be effecting the markets right now because they are doing well. However, when you look at economic history, whether the US depressions and deep recessions, or the rise and fall of other country economies, the similarity that seems to generally stand out is the erosion of the middle class because without a strong middle class over time their are fewer dollars out there chasing goods and services. Economic impacts tend to happen slowly until they crash toward the end.

Quite true, driver. Happily, the absence of a mortgage means one's ""rent"" is pretty darn cheap. If I include all my housing-related fixed expenses (property taxes and utilities), I'm at about $650 a month. For this area, that's equivalent to a 500 square-foot dry cabin off in some mosquito-infested swamp.","
I don't regard house (used as a primary residence) as an investment - it's a life style choice. A good one and bringing lots of joy, but as an investment house stinks (most of the time, most of the cases). Even when the price appreciation is high (like in some areas), overall cost of owning a house (from mortgage, to upkeep, to insurance, to improvements, to taxes, to everything else) outweighs ""investment benefits"". People will always quote price A they bought and price B as they sold and claim they ""made"" B-A on the house. Never mind all those mentioned costs they had to bear over the years (they somehow don't count). Never mind agent fees.

House is a great investment for a bank, not the owner-resident. Especially in America, when people own their houses for less than 10 years at a time. I don't count professional house investing (for rent or flip), as those are ruled by different dynamics. Even if one buys a house and then enjoys real boom in its value, it usually creates a lot of strain on them as they may not have cash flow to support increased taxes, insurance due to that growth. They can easily become house rich, cash poor. If they tap into that equity without income supporting it, we have foreclosure within couple of years. Also, if you buy a house and enjoy it going up in value, you still made nothing if you have to stay in the area (all other houses also increased in value). This happens for a lot of people, when they move from place to place, buying a house each time. They end up paying enormous amounts in closing/selling costs that they never seem to have accounted in their overly optimistic math of ""investment"". So, unless you move to middle of nowhere, you ""made"" nothing just yet. Perhaps, tapping into equity in reverse mortgage might get you some value in the old age.

As I said, it's a great life choice, but it's a terrible ""investment"". At best, it may be a ""store of value"" for some and perhaps force savings vehicle for those who are responsible enough to pay their bills, but otherwise spend every cent they get. However, those who know how to save, can invest in much better assets without bearing the costs - provided they can live in a rented apartment or house and put that difference away.","Buying in at the right time is also something hard to beat. Some older generations around me were very lucky in their timing, buying when it was possible for normal working people. Of course, they pretend to be the second coming of Warren Buffett, but it was nearly all luck, and still often some parental aid, too. And then they gripe about taxes reflecting that value - no sympathy here, just snickers and rolled eyes.

Regarding making money, only if you sell, right? Or maybe take out a HELOC to fund an investment.

IMNSHO, the economy is far too dependent on housing.","

To take any kind of loan, you need to have a capacity to pay it back. Or at least used to... So if you bought a cheap house on low income then it rose in value way past your ability to buy it again, you can't take the loan, unless you wish to be foreclosed. Even HELOC, as it can be recalled and still needs to be paid according to some schedule. Now, if you invest the money into something making a better return, but it's now taking double risk (the investment and the house). I also agree, dependency of our economy on bricks and mortar rather than productive assets is something to be concerned about, not to celebrate.","

I have to disagree with you Mr. driver. If I live in a house for 10 years and it appreciates by $150,000. I can pay a lot of taxes, maintenance, and utilities with that $150,000. Not to mention that you don't have to pays taxes on the $150,000. gain when you sell.","
You paint a very bleak picture. Someone once said that the only things we really know are those things that we learned through personal experience. I am speaking from owning 10 homes over my adult working life and gradually being able to pay cash (mainly from profits off previous homes) for the last two. The money you save by doing this is unbelievable. I realize that all of our experiences may not be the same.","
1. To appreciate 150 grand in 10 years, how much did you pay? Say it appreciated 5 percent per year (above average), it would be $240K. If it is 3 percent (typical long term), it would have to be $440K. Big difference. What makes you think you can achieve consistently above average house appreciation?
2. Where do you go after you sell? How much it costs?
3. I'd say it's quite likely that if the appreciation was average, $150K was easily eaten by taxes, insurance, living costs and closing costs/selling expenses. But say it's just half of it, more likely two-thirds, especially if you experience only average price appreciation (higher starting price). If you actually took a 30 year mortgage and paid nothing extra, you still owe more than 75 percent of the original amount, so most of your payments went to cover interest. No, my friend, you didn't make $150K. You'd be lucky to cash 50 grand, which is better to have or not, but I can think of much better schemes to turn this kind of money into real 150 grand. But you wouldn't have enjoyed your house, which is nice thing and there is nothing wrong with that. It's actually great. Just not as investment.","
You misunderstand my intention. I think house is a great place for a family to grow up in. But it's much more expensive than anybody wants to admit, because people think it would make them look bad, as they had overspent. So they disregard those costs in the calculus and overexpose benefits.

You with your ability to actually save the cash and roll it forward, are an exemption, not rule. Majority of people I see, never get from the thumb of the debt, definitely not in 10 years from first purchase, because every penny they make goes to cover the interest and expenses and life. They usually have very little equity after 10 years, as second mortgage would eat all the possible appreciation. BTW, I almost paid off my house, on schedule to do it in less than 3 years (could send a check now, if wanted to), so I'm not talking about myself.","So...given that I live in a market that is an anomaly (and one that seems to actually be slowing down), we realized a 40% ROI in 3 years of ownership of our first home in Seattle. We had to use all of that gain as a downpayment in order to fit our current home within our budget. Our current home sold for exactly the same as we paid for our first home 3 years ago, just is bigger and located in the suburbs.

We were lucky and had the funds for our first down payment to be able to purchase when we did, or we would be like our friends and stuck putting every dime of our savings into a home. My issue is that while they are ""in"" the market and likely realizing excellent gains, same as we did, they are cash flow strapped and have no emergency fund. I can't live like that and probably wouldn't live like that.","Even property and home ownership is in real danger.....

The alternative to home ownership is renting. And even in the worst possible scenario you can piece together, such as the above, the homeowner still comes out ahead. Coming out ahead is good when you consider the poor guy who spent all those years renting, while still having to pay utilities, taxes, various home expenses and paying enough monthly rent for his landlord to pay all his expenses, taxes, home repairs and still make a profit. How far in the minus column is that poor guy after 10 or 20 years.","
I actually disagree with the math. Nobody showed me a comprehensive calculation that includes all costs of home ownership and compares them with costs of renting. It's not there, because real estate industry would kill any suggestion the math may not be as great. Another reason is large number of variables, not conducive for general public to actually understand a multivariable calculation. It's usually couple of great sounding one-liners, like ""you lock in your payment, think how many times your landlord will raise the rent"", aimed at ending any in-depth discussion about the subject and going with the warm feelings.

BTW, really poor guy will never get approved for any kind of decent mortgage in a decent house in a safe neighborhood. Not so poor guy will have enough to get a decent rental, save the rest and invest it on a side.

I agree that it is somewhat ridiculous how they come up with their rating criteria.

Yeah, ""perfect score"" is generally lots of credit available, very little actually taken at the moment of scoring, long history of paying on time (that's obvious), no recent shopping (inquiries) and no recently open accounts - at least one year; I started my car loan in May last year. The most entertaining is reading those ""negative"" factors on explanations. They can be completely contradictory to each other. At this level, one should never even bother reading that junk, as it's fractions of points. The important stuff is pay it on time, don't take more than you can handle and keep balances on your CC low vs. limits, including those you pay off every month. The score ""doesn't know"" you are going to pay it off. It takes snapshot of what the CC company billed to you last month. So if you have frequent large spending sprees (e.g. going on business paying by CC and getting reimbursed), make your CC company raise the limit far beyond what you are spending.","Yep, the limits matter. I have a few cards with moderately high limits, but I pay them off every month. I've had a score consistently in the 820s-830s for a long time, for whatever reason, it doesn't inch higher.
","A cost to think about in my area is condo HOAs. As condos are the most viable way for many youngish people without the bank of mom and dad to get into the ""ownership"" game, these fees are a real impact, and can be significant. For an average 350K condo here, they are often $400+, and you don't get the tax gift/FIRE subsidy/renter penalty. In those cases, renting might not pencil out so bad, especially if one doesn't stay forever or can't deal with any kind of maintenance fee or assessment.
","I don’t know, but I do know that taxes, mortgage interest, and home repairs and replacements certainly ate up any rise in prices. I also know that on the coasts, housing prices are so high that it is almost impossible to for first time buyers to come up with a down payment that results in an affordable mortgage.

@tbirdmarco ....When I first got out of college, my first ""real"" job was with Xerox. I was a tech representative at the time, the guy who fixed their ""Star"" system. That was essentially a typewriter(s) that was wired directly into their print shop. It was all hooked together via ethernet and the first real ""network"" I was really aware of.

So, what's this have to do with your cold calling interview?

Well, after about a year of being the tech rep, the Star sales rep was let go as she had a hard time hitting her quota on a consistent basis. Since I was providing her a lot of leads, the viewed me as a potential and successful sales person. Most of the offices I visited had temp workers manning the typewriters and print shop. They would spend a month or so with one company and then would be moved to the next. They knew exactly which companies needed such a system as Xerox's Star System. They would let me know who they were....mainly large legal and financial firms.

I resisted going into sales. I did not want to be a sales person and didn't have any experience in sales.

My boss at the time said the Sales Manager would send me for sales training. If after 6 months in the field as a sales person I was not successful, or still did not like it, I could have my old job back as a Tech.

Not sure about today, but back in the late '80s when I first started working for them, Xerox sales training was considered the best in the world.

In 6 months, I was the 2nd revenue producer of Star Systems in all of Xerox. I made more money that I ever thought possible. I was hooked.

But, the least favorite part of my job was cold calling, which I did for 8-9 hours every Tuesday to set up demos and appointments for the rest of the week and into the next week. Lots and lots of phone work was involved. Sometimes once I finished one meeting, I'd look in the same office building for firms that may be able to use one of our Star Systems and would cold call in person. Again, hated doing that.

Over time, I didn't have any time for cold calling, however. I was just asking my customers for their introductions to other companies they thought might be a potential customer. Funny how lawyers and legal personnel all seem to know each other, regardless of the firms they worked for.

Parlayed that into a 10 year career with Xerox. Went onto become a Sales Manager, a Sales Training Manager (based in Leesburg, VA), a District Manager and finally the Director of Marketing for their (then new) color printers and copiers.

Since then I seem to have been in demand and have worked for companies small and large, with several startups during the (then) exploding tech arena in the '90s.

It all starts with cold calling, though.

If Craig @isellhondas is still around, he'll probably concur. So will @driver100.

The key is to have a clear upward path from the cold calling position. If successful, it can be very lucrative.

Good luck!

Home ownership should be no investment unless you have more than one. Your home is where you want to live....nothing more, nothing less. Whether prices go down or up, you need a place to live, that is what a home should be.


Some examples of why home investment can be bad....really bad;
1. Before we bought, we rented a townhouse in Florida. The people we rented it from bought it as an investment. Paid $650000 for it, used is $250000 pension money from Southwest as the down payment. They had to walk away when the value decreased to $250000 in 2008.
2. My brother rented his apartment 35 years ago......rent was $550 a month. Everyone told him to buy, and since then condo prices have probably tripled or quadrupled. But, because of rent controls he ended up paying $930 a month after 35 years. His rent didn't even double over that time....now who is the smart one?
3. Our place in Florida reached a peak of being worth about $220000 just before the crash of 2008. We bought it for $125000 in 2011. Original price 22 years ago was about $110000, Our home is worth maybe $160 to $170K, but I am not a financial genius, just bought at the right time....still, not a huge profit over 7 years, especially if you include costs to maintain, taxes, etc. It is buying a lifestyle....that is what it is....I don't consider it an investment at all.

If I include all my housing-related fixed expenses (property taxes and utilities), I'm at about $650 a month. For this area, that's equivalent to a 500 square-foot dry cabin off in some mosquito-infested swamp.
$400/month for me. I couldn't rent anything bigger than a backyard tool shed for that amount.","Depending on the region, I am sure that is true. In my area, for a condo with a heavy HOA, it might take a lot longer.

I remember when a friend of mine moved to suburban Atlanta, buying was definitely cheaper than renting in his area, and I have little doubt one would be running in the black after a couple years.","
I got a dark single-bedroom apartment in dilapidated university housing community for $270/month in Tallahassee in 1998. The place was not very nice, but it was quite safe, even if surrounded by a sketchy neighborhood (university police patrolled the area regularly, so the ""neighbors"" would not venture in). Quite a bargain for a foreign student from a non-First World country. I lived there until I graduated in 2001.

There was a little mold here and there that had to be dealt with. Insects, too (the area was surrounded by old trees). I remember I was once attacked by an angry mob of fireants dropping from my AC unit above my bed. Fortunately after couple of bites I realized what was going on and took care of it. It was a great time.

Now I'm paying $270 per month just to cover my HOA.","
They forgot to mention timing is a factor. If you bought at the peak in about 2006, you would still be underwater today in most areas. Our Florida place would have been worth $210k then, and $16 - $170k now. They never tell you those things, just use a chart with a long timeline."

Well, we are now from unequivocal ""great news"" down to ""benefit of the doubt"". At least now we can have a discussion. Yes, this could turn into a good news.

Ok, consider me cautioned. However I am not suggesting that someone rush out and buy or sell stocks based on one tidbit of news. That would be very foolish. That said, the stock market is a very good gauge of whether current news is considered positive or negative and reacts very quickly. This news was greeted with an extremely positive response. This means the financial sector voted with their cash that they considered this to be very good news, which is at odds with some of the negative reactions here.","The stock market can be disconnected from the economy shorter term. Politics is but one of many factors. My big fear is that when the slowdown comes, and it is as much related to economic cycles as who runs Washington, with interest rates climbing and potentially large tariffs it all potentially adds up to stagflation which is nasty stuff and can be difficult to combat. However, as I stated, sometimes Washington talk is negotiation posturing, but that always can carry a risk it goes awry. Personally, the US was in a great (and maybe unique) economic position in the 50's and 60's, but the world has changed and I don't see how we can get back to that realistically. But on the flip side, globalizing has led to lower prices through more trade. Globalization is not going away and BOTH political parties championed those moves years back. Then throw in the disruption of technology, much like industrialization in the late 1800's and early 1900's, and all this change hurts some and helps others within the US economy. What I think we need as a nation is leadership and bipartisan governing, which seems kind of like the opposite of what is actually occurring right now. btw, never follow the lemmings on Wall Street because that herd mentality often can end up leading your money astray down the road.","Very interesting, and likely, correct. 24 months out, maybe 36 months if we are lucky, we will be in a new reality. People who work in credit and collection-related fields are already preparing for it.

The stimulus is most perplexing, with the regime using moves usually reserved for times of mild economic crisis. When such policy is applied to an already warm economy, what will they do when the pendulum moves to its next position?
","The markets and financial sector are disconnected from actual people, too. Examine markets and then examine socio-economic trends of the past few decades. Markets keep rising, chasms keep widening. How long will (or can) it continue?

The markets gauge the sentiments of the top few. How many people own what percentage of securities, or any financial instruments? Introduce pity-the-rich tax policy, and the beneficiaries will react positively.

Don’t think I’m not checking here every day! LOL!

Regarding cars and tariffs, I’m thinking this is not going to end well for the consumer. Prices for cars we mostly know and love in this forum (BMW/Mercedes/VW/Volvo/Audi), all are going to become much less competitive price wise. Yes, I’m sure some of the tarrif will be absorbed by the manufacturers. But, there will be a significant amount that will be tacked on to the MSRP.

That’s not good for anyone.....not the manufacturers.....not the consumers. And, it’s likely to spur an already rising inflationary rate.

At best, it’s ominous. I see Honda, Toyota and Nissan perhaps picking up some market share. The U.S. manufacturers are all but abandoning cars for trucks, CUVs, SUVs.

Gas prices have been rising, too.

Then we have the roll back of banking oversight.

This all paints an ugly picture in the next 12-18-24 months. And, like what happened 10 years ago, it’s going to take a Herculean effort to get things back on track, again. The last time, it took 4-5 years for the previous administration to get things moving in the right direction, again.

There's an interesting thing going on right on with the economy, and it relates to everyone. Despite the allegedly ""good"" economy (debatable, but that's another story outside our purview) there is something that has just about all economists quite puzzled:

Wages remain stubbornly stagnant, and no one is quite sure why. Obviously, someone or something, is not coughing up the cash.","No ALDI here, but I have been to them in Germany. Do the cashiers get to sit like they do there? I might be in the upper midwest later in the year, and will probably visit one, I hear they carry many German goods.
","Stagnant wages (especially in comparison to many cost of living factors) have been an issue for a long time, right? For some reason, benefits to workers are never part of what determines a ""good"" economy.

Under normal circumstances, you are right. You don't get the cart that you used for your shopping, you get the cart from the person ahead of you. But since this counter-fitter lady said her washers had worked before, she must make sure she gets her shopping cart back.

If the washer, or even a slug, is the same dimension of a quarter it will work. In a pinch, when I was quarterless, I have used washers. Since it returns to you when you return the cart no harm no foul. Once when I did that as I was returning the cart someone wanted to grab it and give me the quarter he was going to use, I refused it explaining that I used a washer. ","
They built an Aldi's in my neighborhood about a year ago. It's the only competition to the local HEB, and I can't say that I care for it very much. Where I live there are a lot of people who don't have cars, and they tend to steal the shopping carts. Or at least ""borrow"" them to roll their groceries home. The HEB put the automatic locking brakes on their carts to slow down the practice. Aldi's as you mentioned requires a quarter, which isn't much. The other day, on one of the side streets, I spotted about 20 shopping carts. I slowed down for a better look, and it was a whole string of Aldi shopping carts all locked together.

The former may be true, but don't proclaim victory on 30 yard line after a 4-yard run. So far we have one industrial manufacturer after another announcing moving production overseas for those products that were affected by retaliatory tariffs (Hog, now Polaris). What do you think will happen after another self-proclaimed victory, or even if it actually does result in some kind of concessions months down the road? Do you think those guys will bring it back here after they just opened it in Poland, Czechia, or Romania and enjoy labor that costs quarter or less than here? Fat chance.

I assumed the survey would be about the poorly done newspaper and their bias problems. The paper has made it impossible to give comments on their articles so I thought this could be interesting.

I may not be speaking for everyone here, but I think that most of us can look back on some of the things we have done and feel rather thankful / surprised that we made it this far.

As for bike speeds, I can see why they would include limits for machines that are not self-powered. However, I typically ride my bike at 20 mph or more on flats, and DEFINITELY far faster than that down hills. As long as I'm the one expending the effort, I'll go however fast I want. It is rare that speed is in excess of the auto limit, but it does happen now and again!","
Here are some of my favorite lyrics from an old song by Waylon Jennings:

But when you cross that 'Ol Red River Hoss, that just don't mean a thing
Cause when you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King....","











Most states require that ebikes that can go faster than 20 MPH to be registered and licensed and the rider needing an endorsement on their license.

You're right. Same in OH. But, I think they skirt this by claiming it's delivered with a 20 MPH speed limit, but have ways of getting around the issue by limiting the speed with software. Once you find out how to ""undo"" the artificial limiter, you're off to the races.

But you know....skinny little tires, limited braking....20 mph on a bicycle is fast enough....you hit one little rock, or catch a groove in the road and you're in for it---as we say in the motorcycle world---""a few seconds on the Belt Sander of Life"".


No disagreement. I removed the software limiter on mine. Got it up to 35 MPH. At first it was a hoot. But, as you say, once you realize one blow out, one unexpected rock on the roadway, one pothole you didn't anticipate, and you're doing a not so graceful exit off the seat of the bike into blacktop, a telephone pole, a car, or Lord only knows what else.....at 35 MPH, with nothing but a flimsy helmet protecting you.

I actually put the limiter back on. 20 MPH on a bike is plenty for me.

Now, in my youth, when I was riding motor cycles regularly, there wasn't enough speed that could satisfy me.

I never said I was the brightest bulb in the lamp! Surprised I'm still in (relatively) good shape as a result.

On downhill stretches bike racers can hit or even exceed 55 MPH. During the last Olympics bike races actually put ran the motorcycles that were recording the race on the down hill sections. I have approached 50 on a down hill sprint, that was a rush.




Nope...not doing that. Pretty cool to watch, though. Actually, the brakes on my bike a tons better than what I road as a kid. I have hydraulic disks, slotted rotors and dual piston calipers.

This, vs a small piece of rubber rubbing on a steel rim to slow me down when I was younger. Or, even worse, coaster brakes.","

Hint: I'm sure even the kids today have figured out being the driver when going to the drivein is not the best way to go. The back has always been the way to do it.

Gotta say the company has been a pleasure to work with. Some of those Kickstarter campaigns are a study in how to frustrate your customer, if they deliver what they promised at all. Not these guys.

Went out to dinner last night. Round trip was 6.6 miles not the 7 I said it would be but 7 was a pretty good guess. MPG was 12.9 on trip computer ""A"". I set trip computer ""B"" at about 2.5 miles from home on the way back just for the fun of it. MPG was 17.6 , for trip computer ""B"" when we got home. The only way I can begin to explain this is that the car was cold (not driven all day until we went out to dinner last night) so by the time I was driving it home after dinner it was warmed up. Again, just a guess as to why the difference from 12.9 MPG (11 miles) to 17.6 MPG (about 2.5 miles).

Today we both had scheduled doctor's appointments with the same doctor. Round trip was 11.0 miles and the MPG was 17.4 (only used trip computer ""A""). Some of that was cold driving on initial start up but the rest was with the car fully warmed up. So, that 15 MPG that I mentioned in my post yesterday is probably about what that car gets on average for in town driving under all temperature conditions.

This morning when we got home, Mrs. j got out of the car first to get the mail. While I was still in the car recording numbers, she wanted to know what I was doing and I told her, ""hold on I'll explain this when we get in the house"". Once in the house I said, ""your car is a gas hog. Cars today get better gas mileage so maybe we should get you a new Legacy"". Well, that did it. She said, ""I knew I'd be sorry for saying that burgundy Subaru we were behind when we went out for dinner on our anniversary last week would come back to haunt me. And furthermore, even though I don't know anything about cars, I know enough that spending tens of thousands of dollars for a car to get a little better gas mileage is a dumb economic move"".

I think I lost that argument so now what do I do?

I like my bike. I ride it every weekend. If I have to pick up prescriptions at Walgreens (about 3 miles away, or go to the post office (about 5 miles away), I hop on the bike. I have a hilly connecting road to my cul-de-sac. On a regular bike, after riding a mile or so, I was winded since the hills are pretty steep. With my FLX, I don't have to peddle at all. But, I usually do give a slight pedal while using the electric motor.

Sometimes I don't peddle at all and and just a rider using the throttle to control my speed.

If I had a 10 mile commute, I'd be tempted to use it daily for that. But, my office is in my home (about 5 feet from my bedroom).

I haven't really had to do much for maintenance. I've oiled the chain a couple of times (it's a 9-speed). It really didn't need it though. I keep an eye on the tires to make sure I'm not picking up anything that would pierce them.

Great survival rate.  Now for my post since I kept with the “car” theme.

Beginning in May of this year, I have contacted and moaned and groaned and called the delivery and subscription department of my local newspaper to report that my newspaper has been delivered 1-2 hours later than their guaranteed delivery time of 6:30 AM on weekdays and 7:30 AM on weekends. Furthermore, on at least a dozen occasions in the past 3 months I got NO newspaper delivered.  Every time I call, I get a customer service rep who, in a very noticeable foreign accent, assures me they have escalated the problems to “upper management” and have notified the distributor of the problem and further assured me I would receive a phone call from the distributor to assist me in solving this persistent delivery issue (no pun intended!).  I have never, ever received a phone call from anyone in all these months and my problems reached a denouement (look the word up guys) with no paper delivered Saturday, Sunday and this morning.  I was at the end of my rope.  My usual phone calls to the paper’s subcontractor that handles deliveries and subscriptions were even more frustrating with promises I would get a call from the delivery contractor.

After many attempts, I called the newsroom of the Ft. Lauderdale paper and asked for help.  I was transferred to a consumer service manager.  She spoke to me in a beautiful Brooklyn accent and I complimented her on her outstanding oral communication skills - she laughed so I knew I was talking to the right person.

After looking up my subscription on her computer and reading all the referrals sent to “upper management” (she laughed at the term UPPER MANAGEMENT) she said, “...and after 26 requests to the delivery and subscription department you mean to tell me no one ever called you to respond to your phone calls and your delivery problems have not been solved?”  I responded in the affirmative.  She first told me that it was obvious the delivery subcontractor did not want to talk to me or he would have called me.  Secondly, she said that talking to the delivery and subscription department, which is located in THE PHILIPPINES, is not solving the problem because all they do is email the distributor- they can’t call him from the Far Western Pacific Ocean area.

She promised to resolve this and said she would call me tomorrow afternoon to report her findings.  Her son went to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan as well as NYU (like me) and said she will get to the bottom of this fiasco as the mother of an alum.

Interest in watching golf on TV may be different, but the game itself is on the down trend.

I would suggest not, but there is really no way to determine that.",No one has broken his record of 18 major victories yet. Not even close.,"
Ummmm...

""Jack Nicklaus has won the most majors, achieving 18 victories during his career. Second on the list is Tiger Woods, who has won 14 majors to date; his most recent major victory was at the 2008 U.S. Open. Walter Hagen is third with 11 majors; he and Nicklaus have both won the most PGA Championships with five.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men's_major_championships_winning_golfers","Yes, only Tiger Woods has a prayer and at his age that’s very unlikely. AND “Additionally, Nicklaus shares the record for the most U.S. Open victories with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan, each winning four times.[8] Harry Vardon holds the record for the most Open Championship victories, winning six times during his career.[9] Nicklaus, Woods, Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen are the only golfers to have won all four of the majors during their career,[10] thus achieving the so-called career slam.” He also won the PGA 5 times, a record he shares with Hagen, and won the Master’s 6 times. It is so unusual for sports records to hold up this long.","I'm still searching. I found a 2017 Nissan Sentra S in Aspen White at Bill Luke Tempe selling for $12,500. That's if I finance the purchase through Bill Luke. The price jumps to $13,500 if you bring in your own bank financing.

It is a stick and these cars look good in white to me. Less than 6,000 miles? It is a one-owner and the Car Fax is clean.","While I search for Sentra's I'm watching YouTube videos on the 2013 Ford Focus ST. The reviews are very complimentary of the car's power and actually it's overall build quality. The '13 Ford Focus ST in Tangerine Scream is still for sale for $11,500 in Alamo with 61,000 miles on it.


2013 Ford Focus ST 6-speed

I finally spotted a defect on it's body. It's on the left rear qtr.panel just rear of the wheel well - it's a dinky scrape probably 3/4 of an inch long and it's black. I could just treat that one myself. The Recaro seats fit front two riders like a glove. The family Sentra S or the fast hatchback in Tangerine Scream? Both 6-speed sticks - the ghastly mileage would favor the Sentra S by about 5 mpg I would guess.

Or just hold with the '11 Kia Soul and continue paying the pup off in order to not have any underwater cash to finance with the purchase. The latter is no doubt my best route.","Let’s face it, Molinari was the best golfer at the Open today.  Not as technical in his game as Spieth or Thomas or even Woods - but he was consistent and did not make errors.  He played “his” game.

I am a fan of Woods because of his accomplishments.  Spieth, Thomas, McElroy, and Fowler along with about 8-9 other twenty-somethings are the future of golf.  Before Woods, I rarely watched golf on TV.  Now, I watch it all the time.  

Drives off the tee used to be 275-290 yards - now 320-350 yards is quite common.  This younger generation of pro golfers concentrate on physical fitness and work out in the gym every chance they get along with their personal trainers.  They use computer programs and cameras to evaluate their swings.  They are technicians with an army of specialists coaching them on every motion.  They are phenoms - but are superior in their game because of the technology, training and physical fitness which serve to expand their God-given skills and talents.

Woods grabbed the attention of the world because of his talent and the twenty-somethings have rekindled that attention to make golf a great spectator sport.  I can’t play golf very well, but I love watching these guys play and am awed by their talents.","
Big red flag. Expect bait and switch and all other tricks in the book. Proceed with extreme caution.","@iluvmysephia1, I just don’t think the Sentra is going to make you happy.
@abacomike, totally agree that Molinari was the best golfer over the course this weekend. To play all bogey-free, plus 2 birdies, in that wind, on a Sunday, was phenomenal. And how exciting that he is the first Italian to win a major! A great golf tournament with so many amazing golfers all bunched together on the final day.","
But you're only as good as your last movie, as they say in Hollywood.","Well, that record has stood since 1986, and there have been many great golfers since then, so . . .","@iluvmysephia1, I just don’t think the Sentra is going to make you happy.

I think you might be right, suydam. That's why I'm looking in to the hot hatches. The '13 Ford Focus ST 6-speed goes head-ta-head against the Mazdaspeed3! and wins because they like it's suspension setup more and it's wonderful ability ta hold the corner going in to a turn fast. FWD torquesteer appears to have been mastered by Ford engineers with this car. Wonderfully entertaining video here.","The ST may have a ""wonderful ability,"" but it's not enough to keep the MS3 from beating it by nearly 1.5 seconds around VIR. A real LSD makes a huge difference. No knock on the ST for a street driven car, however.","One last shot from Keeneland- my Club Sport. I didn't trophy, but there's no shame in losing to a 507 and a 1600 GT...","Yeah, they mention that the ST doesn't have LSD and the 3 does. Ford uses torque vectoring and these guys loved it's track manners better.","Again, it's not an issue on a purely street driven car, but on the track the ST will use up it's front brakes all too quickly. The front binders get really hot braking for a corner, then instead of getting a chance to cool they get used again when the driver accelerates out of the corner.","
I'll take that as a complement that I haven't lost my touch and can still keep my readers entertained. Maybe I should ask @driver100 to find me a publisher for my upcoming million word book.

You don't have to be a Titan to have drama at work. The last few years before retirement a new boss took over and immeadiately began causing turmoil with staff. I had a run in with him in 2015 and nearly resigned then. As it was I decided to retire a year early just to be rid of him in 2017. In the year since I've had a few moments where I had second thoughts and considered that maybe I had overreacted and made a bad choice.

Then yesterday one of my old work associated stopped by to tell me that partially due to this boss's overbearing attitude and mind games two bus driver's had hung themselves in the year since I left.

Well, I was a proponent of MBWA (management by walking around).  My secretaries disliked this approach to managing a large school because I was rarely in my office.  So when important phone calls came in from the Superintendent’s office or Asst. Superintendent’s office, they were always taking messages or explaining I was unavailable because I was visiting classrooms, which I did every day.  That kept staff on their toes - they never knew when I would stop into their classroom and observe instruction.

My boss is great. He really is. He’s smart. He’s fair. If he believes in you, he’ll go to bat for you. I’ve worked for him for over 20 years. If he changes positions or companies, he usually drags me with him with a nice pay bump as a reward.

After all these years, sometimes we don’t agree. This is one of those cases. I explained to him what I thought. He believed there might be something we could perhaps license from this lady and her company. He just asked that I go into the meeting with an open mind.

Not sure I did that, but I gave her the opportunity to make her case. She wanted to try to bully me (who has twice the experience than she has age). That wasn’t the correct way to do that.

I wrote the report of the trip on the plane last night while flying home. I assessed that the concept wasn’t a bad one. It’s nowhere near our focus, though. I wrote that IF her claim of $20M in funding is true (which she failed to provide proof of after repeated requests to do so), and given what I guesstimate the current run rate of salary and expenses (she says she has 20 employees, even though I only counted 7) her funding runway will end somewhere around 2021.

She probably needs more $$$$ to complete her project and was turned down by the funding community. And, is now looking to the tech companies (I doubt I was the only one she contacted) to continue funding.

She has interest from some companies (again hard to quantify), but no significant revenue to speak of. She does show some revenue from some mid-level companies, but it’s not very much and not repeatable.

We look at these types of companies all the time....startups who have complementary technology and need investment or want to sign a licensing agreement from us. I don’t usually get involved with this type of activity. But, I’m called in from time to time to assess the possible potential.

She’s pretty slick gathering tech contacts. If she was funded, she would have proudly announced who her partners were. Couldn’t get that info from her.

I don’t think my boss knew of any of this. All her heard was she had some interesting tech (after a brief elevator pitch) and wanted to engage us about it.

I’ve probably heard a dozen pitches from outside of the company. Only one was worthwhile and we did invest some money (not millions, though). The rest either weren’t viable, were not managed well, or like this case, not aligned with what we do as a company.

Knowing my boss, I’ve spent 3X the time telling you guys about it than he’ll allow me to expend with him. I’ll bring it up from time-to-time with him and he’ll half kiddingly dismiss this whole thing with...”shall we talk about the dogs you were all hot and bothered about?”. That will be the end of the conversation.

Thanks for letting me whine. Got home around 7 a.m. Dropped into bed for about 3 hours of sleep and feel better already.

PS....my hot dog was $11, too. I liked it. Was it worth $11? Nah! But add in the duck fat fries and it became more palatable. Their “bitter” beer was pretty good, though.","tjc78 said:

I thought you were going to tell us that she was pestering you on LinkedIn because she was interested in a relationship or at least a few dates. I hear that is its main use these days.

I deleted mine simply because I wasn't using it and I started to get a lot of spam at work which I strongly suggest is from LinkedIn as I only us my work email internally and cannot do anything not work related on the net (yes they monitor it).
Our place has the capability to monitor anything and has a pretty large blocked sites list, but based on how much I see on people’s screens big brother (IT) can’t be doing too “monitoring”

I stream Pandora at work and login here a few times during the day if I can.  I’ve always said that if anyone ever questioned it, I would start logging the smoke break abusers and demand they are called out for it.  My office is the last door before the hallway to the lounge/outdoor smoking area and there are some that I see 5 and 6 times a day... 

In my last position I had one of the “abusers”. I was able to keep it in check.  My replacement, not so much.  She is back up to her old tricks.   Someone came to me about it the other day, I said she doesn’t work for me any longer.

Ain't that the truth. I was thinking the same thing.

Sexual harassment has always been something you had to be aware of but it is out of control today. It has gotten to the point that I sometimes think the only reason some people go to work is to see how much trouble they can create.

Here is a little story from my past that, if this was today, I'm not so sure I would have done this but I did know who I was talking with.

Back in the late 70's before I was coerced into management our group secretary, who had been recently divorced less than a year because of an unfaithful husband, came to me one day because she knew I dabbled with home maintenance and wanted some advice since she wanted to save the cost of hiring a plumber. She had come to me several times before and she was getting pretty good with things around the house from what she was telling me over the past several months. But now she wanted to know how to remove and replace a shut off valve in her basement that led to the outside hose bib. It was leaking and wouldn't shut off the water to the bib. She had already found that the screw that held the washer in place was corroded and could not be removed so that she could just replace the washer. Fall was coming and she knew she had to shut off the water so that the bib didn't freeze with winter coming. The bib was not leaking, only the shut off capability of the inside shut off valve which was about a foot from the basement concrete block wall and was connected with copper tubing. Like I said, she was getting pretty good at things around the house and knew what had to be done. OK, that's the lead-in to the story which I will tell via my conversation method:

She comes into my cube one morning and said.

Her: Hey jmonroe, I want you to tell me how to sweat.

Me: Run around the building a couple times at lunch time. That otta do it.

Her: No damn it, I'm serious.

That is when she told me what she wanted to do.

Me: I could tell you but it probably won't help you very much because that is something you have to see done a few times before you try it yourself.

Just as I'm about to tell her I can come over and do it, she said.

Her: I sorta thought that, so maybe I should take up my neighbors offer to do it. He said he's done it a couple times and has been successful sweating copper tubing but I didn't want to bother him.

Me: As long as you're confident that he can help, that might not be a bad idea.

Her: I might as well since I really can't afford a plumber right now.

I guess this is the time to say she is about my age, pretty attractive with 2 kids about my kids age. So, to have some fun I say.

Me: Are you sure he just wants to be helpful and doesn't want something else.

She is still sensitive about her divorce and says in an irritated voice.

Her: DAMN IT JMONROE, IS THAT ALL YOU GUYS EVER THINK ABOUT?

Not wanting to sound like she has intimidated me I pause to calm myself and say.

Me: Ah, ahhh...no, but it beats the hell out of everything that's in second place.

No harm done because I knew who I was talking to. FWIW, she had her neighbor replace the valve and she told me she could not have done it herself with just verbal instructions but now that she saw it done, she thinks she could do it herself. However, I never heard her say she ever did it, so not sure about that.

Again, you have to know who you are talking to.

Thanks, Sandy.  He is so out of my league as well. But he’s a great grandfather to his grandchildren.  His daughter’s girls are in college and my brother subsidizes their tuition, room and board, and sends them spending money every month.  His two sons don’t need any financial help - his oldest is Chief of Cardiology at a large hospital conglomerate in the Raleigh/Durham area.  His other son is the owner of a huge plastics manufacturing company and is out of my brother’s league, financially.  

Unfortunately, my kids don’t have much so I help out whenever I can.  

As for our love of new cars, what can I say?  At least I am in this car for at least another 28 months because it’s leased and I am buried in it.  Best thing I ever did to end my constant car-buying habit.","
The Jobs story is one I’d like to hear.","
Hey, that was the PRIMO combat ration in the 1960s! You could trade (almost) anything for a can of those!","
In the early days of the IBM PC and the clones thereof, device drivers were rather hard to come by. They had to be written in 8086 assembly language, and almost no one spoke that. I taught myself 8086 assembler by studying the source code for the IBM PC BIOS (which IBM had published), just so I could write a device driver for something that I wanted to connect to my clone PC.

This was before the internet, but we did have BBS (Bulletin Board Systems), which talked to each other and passed things around. I released that device driver, and then did a couple more by request. Next thing you know, Microsoft contacts me, wants me to fly up and interview. They were trying to get one of the very early versions of Windows off the ground, and one thing they needed very badly were device drivers.

I interviewed, but didn’t take their job offer. Looking back, I really should have, I would have become rich off the stock options. Hindsight is always 20/20. Apple of course had spies at Microsoft, and they contacted me and asked me to interview with them, which I did. During the course of my interview at Apple, they took me in to meet Steve Jobs. We got into a discussion of the Motorola 68020 versus the Intel 80386 microprocessor.

Steve Jobs was the type of person, whatever he was doing, whatever he was using, was automatically better than the rest. I admitted that I liked the flat memory model of the Motorola, but really preferred the Intel. When you’re trying to write assembly language, a complex instruction set (CISC) is so much easier to work with than a reduced instruction set (RISC).

To make a long story short, he really didn’t care for me disagreeing with him, called me an “ignorant ___”, so I responded in kind, and things got bad in a hurry. The guy who was walking me around the place hustled me out, took me straight to the airport. Warned me that Steve Jobs might very well cancel my return ticket (which he didn’t, thank goodness).","@graphicguy

GG, I am surprised you would be sent out on this one in a million wild goose chase. If she was so sure of her product she should be glad to go to you to present it. If I wanted to sell someone something, I will kill for an appointment with the right person who will make it happen.

I thought at first it was a young lady who was pursuing you, but, these days that doesn't always end too well either. Maybe your company was testing you....to see how you handled it....what a colossal waste of time and money.....and a late flight which is aggravating too.

OTOH, sometimes the best deals happen from some fluke....but, it would almost never happen chasing down someone with no real credibility.",Well that stinks to be hoodwinked @graphicguy but if it were me I'd probably try to make something out of a weekend in LA to calm my nerves,"

I have my E400 for just over 15 months and my friend with a 2015 Audi RS A8 asked me when I was getting a new car? I said, there is nothing I would like better, and I got the color I want, so why trade? He said, he feels the same way about his Audi.

it is nice to reach the stage of contentment.","I had a bit of an interesting day as well. Not nearly as intense or amusing as the @graphicguy and @henryn stories, though!

I received a call from a previous supervisor who now lives in Tennessee, and he offered me a job down there. I'm trying to take him seriously, but I am just not the type of person who takes anything seriously enough to want to move many thousands of miles for a job.

I was looking at cost of living information, though, and his offer basically doubles my current salary. I need to research this more in terms of taxes, property values, etc. Honestly, I don't see myself fitting in down south. I'm too independent-minded.... The first thing I did was take a look at land for sale in the area to see where might be a nice place to start building a small house. Hahahah","@henryn ....great story. Jobs arrogance is legendary. I cut my teeth on RISC processors, albeit via Unix OS.

Thanks for the empathy everyone. I didn’t want to go. I had already had Skype meetings, con calls, emails, etc. She wanted a “face-to-face”. My boss and I will have a “review” of the meeting on Monday. He and I have a good relationship. He’ll probably say something like....”sorry your Friday was ruined.....we’ll make a point of sending out a blanket email instructing everyone to ignore any further requests from her”....or something to that effect.

Yes, she did have that 26 year old “I’m entitled” attitude.

Anyway, I’m drinking Delta’s libations in the Sky Club for another 4 hours as consolation.","I'd love to get that kind of call. I was contacted last week by a former coworker from 10 years ago who is now managing director of an agency. She asked if I'd be interested in a VP level scientific job.

Well, I guess it isn't the worst possible way to spend a Friday night.","
I am just not much of a mover. I've been here for 23 years straight, and at my current property for 17 years. The inertia is strong! If I was flyin' solo, I would probably at least go check it out. With a family in tow, it somehow seems irresponsible.

Plus, he's been sort of prodding at me every since he left to come help him out, yet he first went to southern TX from here only two years ago. We certainly have a synergistic working relationship, but I have no interest in making a career out of following him around the country.","

@Snake, I remember seeing a show on TV years ago where they were rating hot dogs across the country. They went to a famous hot dog place in Chicago that had a Neon sign hot dog on the roof of the building. I can't remember the name of the place (again) even though you posted a pic of the place when we last critiqued hot dogs in here. The part I liked best is when they interviewed the elderly couple that owned the place and they said they refuse to apply ketchup to their hot dogs. If the customer wanted ketchup, they would provide ketchup packs but they would not deface their hot dogs by applying it themselves and I agree with them. There otta be a law about doing that to hot dogs. jmonroe

Without finding some lug nuts or lug nuts still attached to the rotor studs that snapped off, it's going to be pretty hard to determine what happened. Kinda like what came first, the chicken or the egg. I'm sure they found the wheel and maybe a stress expert can determine from that what happened upon examination. Like examining the wear pattern around the holes in the wheel but again pretty tough to pin down, IMO. And to complicate this, it could have been a combination of a lug nut or two coming off which imposed added stress on the remaining studs which caused them to snap.

I land and turn on my phone to hear a voice mail from her stating something came up and she couldn’t make lunch, but could meet mid afternoon. I’m not feeling good about this.

She wants to meet at her office which is above a florist shop in Westwood. But this isn’t in an area that speaks to me how she’s successful.

We meet. She’s 26, newly minted Harvard grad (so she says). She immediately went into how she just closed $20M in funding (so she says) to develop an app that has little, if anything, that would interest us.

Yeah but I have found that the one critical of them are not exactly the most unbiased groups they are pushing agendas.

The one I really liked is when they put red light cameras at some intersections in my town there was a group staring that at one intersection accidents increased by 300% in the 6 months after installation as opposed to the 6 months prior. The problems with their stats was that the number of accidents went from 1 to 3 and that the 1 happened in the summer months and the 3 happened in the snowy winter months. When you compared the year prior to the year after there were less accidents. 

How many more accidents in the year, one? And you should ask yourself why an intersection with one accident all summer long needs cameras in the first place!","

I used to have the same basic commute, but a littler further on each end, so about 45 miles each way. By leaving at 6:00 AM, I could make it in 55 minutes on a perfect day. Always longer coming home (1:15 was a pretty good day). My record on a rainy Friday was about 2:45. Driving a stick, man my left leg was sore for a week after that trip.
Yeah it’s probably the worst commute you can have in our area.   I did it way back before the whole 202/422 interchange was redone.   Everyone needing 422 West has to get off at 202 south and caused an even bigger backup than you have now right before the turnpike.

@Snake, I remember seeing a show on TV years ago where they were rating hot dogs across the country. They went to a famous hot dog place in Chicago that had a Neon sign hot dog on the roof of the building. I can't remember the name of the place (again) even though you posted a pic of the place when we last critiqued hot dogs in here.

The part I liked best is when they interviewed the elderly couple that owned the place and they said they refuse to apply ketchup to their hot dogs. If the customer wanted ketchup, they would provide ketchup packs but they would not deface their hot dogs by applying it themselves and I agree with them. There otta be a law about doing that to hot dogs.

I feel the same way about ketchup. Also onions which I know many people like but which is inexplicable to me. On the rare occasion that I have a hot dog (much more likely to go for a brat or an Italian sausage) it gets mustard, green pickle relish, and sauerkraut.","

In the video it shows the minivan (Chrysler corp) on flatbed. The studs are all gone on the left front wheel. When loose lug nuts cause the wheel to come off, do all the studs get broken down below the face of the brake rotor?

My question that I wanted to ask earlier in my first post, was is the driver of the minivan responsible for the damage from the separated wheel. She may have recourse in the courts against a shop who put on the wheel improperly or a friend who put the wheel back on the van , but isn't it ultimately she who bears the responsibility for not maintaining a safe vehicle? And that wheel had to have loosened and have been giving symptoms before it came off. She should have slowed and gotten off the road to find out what was causing the vibration.

Curiously, news reports have said little about the 21-year old driver. I wonder if she's politically connected...?

DOT here is going to put in some fancy, obnoxious roundabout in an area where it is not needed because they claim this intersection is something like four times ""more dangerous"" than similar such locations in Alaska. The problem with that stat is that, over the last decade, there have been something like three (THREE) injury crashes, and no fatalities, at this location, with the rest of any collisions being minor at best. Compared to the flow of traffic through here, that stat basically says that you have ZERO chance of suffering an injury here unless you actually try to cause such a collision.

And, yet, this is enough for Federal funding, so why not make a fancy ""improvement"" that will inconvenience only those who have to use the location every day?

This is why people are so leery of government waste.... because it is justified! /sigh","As far as the tariffs go, I find it a little amusing that we have knee-jerk articles like this that are intended to get people's alarm bells ringing. Yes, this type of thing is intended to raise consumer costs. Why? Because it influences consumer behavior and, therefore, tends to push manufacturers toward local production. Why don't people already get that?

So, if everyone is building stuff outside the US because it costs 20% less, then a tariff of 25% means they don't cost less anymore for consumers. No matter what, consumers lose on tariffs. However, the goal isn't to benefit consumers at all (and never was). The goal is to benefit national security because domestic manufacturing, regardless of what it is, means the nation can respond more quickly to any substantial threat should it arise.

A few years ago I was cruising down a back country road when I ran into a recently finished roundabout. The trouble was that this was smack dab in the middle of corn fields, very light traffic and no cross street. It took them almost three years to build the crossroad and no one uses that road. That new road goes nowhere and comes from nowhere. ","Using a war from three quarters of a century ago that won't be fought again in terms of being dependent on machinery as a defense of distracting tariffs is specious at best, IMO. Especially when the mouth booring on about tariffs uses imports for the junk bearing his name, and when his son of a conman son in law is hawking pay for play residency to people who often skim money from offshore production.

To be related to this forum, nobody with real world credentials can link (or has linked) auto imports to national security, nor can defend the burgeoning trade war as anything positive. I suspect the irritation of (maybe former) allies created by the haphazard imposition of tariffs could be be much more damaging to security than a ship full of BMWs and Jaguars. It's all a distraction from other malfeasance.

An interesting take
","The biggest issue I see is that American drivers aren't taught how to use a roundabout - there's a huge learning curve, probably getting worse as distracted driving is such a growing epidemic.

Very nice looking and it looks like you sprung for the better quality deck boards like I did which you won't find at the big boxes. I don't think I have a knot larger than a quarter and you have to look long and hard to find maybe the 20 that I do have. When I did mine I spent LOT of time making the deck look like a deck on a ship. Did tongue and groove on all the ends with a chamfer and since my deck is 40 feet long you can see why I said it took a LOT of time but in the end it was worth it. I am never in a hurry when I do something just like when working on my cars. I don't have to rush because I don't have another job that has to be done to pay the bills.

Yes, your deck will take some work but what you did looks better than plastic. Just be sure to stain it sooner than later. I do mine every other year and feel guilty when it slips to 3 years like it has a few times (my deck is about 18 years old).

Enjoy it, it looks very nice.

Yeah but I have found that the one critical of them are not exactly the most unbiased groups they are pushing agendas.

The one I really liked is when they put red light cameras at some intersections in my town there was a group staring that at one intersection accidents increased by 300% in the 6 months after installation as opposed to the 6 months prior. The problems with their stats was that the number of accidents went from 1 to 3 and that the 1 happened in the summer months and the 3 happened in the snowy winter months. When you compared the year prior to the year after there were less accidents. ","driver100 said:

So I should think like someone trying to justify aggressive driving?
Please don’t - think like someone trying to justify aggressive driving!  One is enough on this forum.  When I think of aggressive driving, I think about the Indianapolis 500 or the Daytona 500.  I also think about drivers who cut in and out of lanes scaring the heck out of most drivers.  I also think about traffic violations and those who cause accidents but never get involved in accidents.  I think about speeders doing 20 mph over the limit.

However, there is the concept of defensive driving strategies - anticipating what other drivers might do or how best to avoid accidents.

In the summer, Arizona is affected by a south to southwesterly monsoonal flow of moist air from the Gulf of California which causes high humidity and heavy rains as far west as the State Border with CA (Blythe area) and covers a large section of the State.  

When I lived in Palm Desert, CA, I could often see lightening from thunderstorm to the east of us near the Blythe area.  We were not affected in the Coachella Valley because we are surrounded to the west, south and north by 8000-10,000 ft. mountains which interfere with the formation of thunderstorms by cutting of the moisture flow.  We were also further west and not affected by the monsoonal flow.

Unfortunately a highway can only accommodate a finite number of cars and still maintain a smooth flow of traffic. During rush hour far more cars attempt to use highways than they can accommodate at a normal flow. This slows down traffic sometimes to a crawl with all lanes filled doing very close to the same speed. In this situation would you ticket all the thousands of cars? To do so would make the situation worse.

I'd use the reasonable and prudent law enforcement standard, and in many cases, it isn't reasonable or prudent for cars to impede traffic at the same exact speed across all lanes; even if it is a dozen simultaneous violators.","

A couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival the doctor said that the hospital was testing an amazing new high-tech machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father He asked if they were interested. Both said they were very much in favor of it
The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor then checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing.
At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping the wife considerably the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him.
The wife subsequently delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain and the husband continued to experience no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.

It's all relative (intended), but in July through September or so there's a significant shot of moisture that comes up from the south and is therefore called a monsoon. What it means is that the humidity goes from 5 - 15% to 40% plus, sometimes 70%. The key is dew point, and it goes up to 55 - 65 degrees during the monsoon, and often above 70. That means that it doesn't become much less hot overnight, such that the lowest temperature is 93 degrees at 6:30 am, after which it goes up again. Today it was 109. Often it's 104 at 11 pm.

That's just it, that's rarely the case. The real case is you have a few bad apples creating bottlenecks of congestion, that then spirals out of control.

Vermont is a very ""foody"" place. I think that the term ""farm to table"" was first used here and there are a lot of great local restaruants. We have very few chain restaurants, and Burlington doesn't even have a McD's. (For trivia buffs, Montpelier is the only State capital without a McD's.)
A few years ago a family from Florida rented a cottage for 2 weeks. They asked for recommendations for Italian restaurants. We told them about 4 that are really good; from a red checked tablecloth red sauce place to high end Northern Italian.

Speaking of restaurants I have a question for you far more worldly types than me. For years I would see commercials for Applebee's on the US TV stations were receive here. Now, when I traveled into the USA over the years I tried most of the chains like TGI Fridays, Chili's, PF Chang's, Olive Garden, etc but somehow missed trying Applebee's. BTW I didn't mind Denny's when I visited there for breakfast. About 10 years ago an Applebee's finally opened up here not far from where I worked. A few of us tried it at lunch shortly after it opened and it was... terrible. Reminded me of airline food with lots of salt and cheese added. Figured maybe they were still new so I stayed away for a few months before going back. It was the same if not worse. Got the impression everything was frozen, then microwaved and finished under a broiler or whatever. I knew it wasn't just me because after that everyone I asked who had been there said much the same thing. Sure enough it closed after a couple more years. Did we just get a bad one or are they all like that?
You got exactly what I got the last 5 times I ate at Applebee’s - something people in 3rd world countries would call food.  But for those of us living in the industrialized world, it was tasteless, over cooked and highly seasoned to camouflage the real taste.  I avoid that place like I avoid standing near people who cough and sneeze without covering their mouths.","
It is a litle humorous to me that this scenario really is typical of a modern day ""terrible time delay"" on airlines. Oh, how good we have it now! In the 90's, not once did I make it across the lower 48 without the trip taking upwards of 24 hours (scheduled time was typically about eight hours).

Most chains now precook the food in a central kitchen, put them in microwave dishes, then ship them to stores.

2 things you can put in the script which I think is kind of funny;

1) They use the car his father provides as a company car as their personal car (cheat and lie), then B&E our house, then steal our car, then lie about a lost wallet....and they don't want to talk to me about it because I said I didn't believe his wallet story and all the other stories and excuses I have had over the years....and they don't want to talk to me because I was rude.

2) My plan was to tell him not to talk to me at family events...he could say hi and goodbye. Their plan, which reached me via my wife, is they barred me from any of their things. So, if a grandchild gets married, my wife will have to go alone. That may be hard to explain to his parents and family members...but, he will make up some story. But, my way, there would still be a bit of a cover up and things would continue. Their way, I am going to be noticeably absent and my poor lovely wife will have to go on her own.

I am hoping they notice this and ask me to change it to what I was going to propose. Then I can say, that was my original plan, but, I like your plan better.

I never understood that law, and I'd be curious to see when it is enforced. NJ has both no pass on right AND keep right except to pass laws.

Which offense takes priority? The camper or the passer? These are the things I ponder while traveling our roadways.

Well... my take is that the idiotic law enforcement officer does idiotic things, like ticket speeders and passers on the right, or some other hogwash.

More enlightened officers will ticket left lane impeders, unsafe slow mergers, unsafe lane changes (cutting cars off), and other traffic restricting illegal movements","

Based on the number of absurd ""reality"" shows on the air, it seems there is an ample supply of such people.",Doesn’t seem like a bad price on that Sentra. Wonder how it drives?,"That's what I'm wondering too, stick!","So I just came back from vacation in Scotland previous Sunday. A bit more than two weeks, first one I enjoyed the cities (Edinburgh, Glasgow and vicinity) then I rented a car and drove to the countryside to see their legendary landscapes. The landscapes did not disappoint, the only regret was I should have shortened my city stay and lengthen the countryside. Anyway, I drove a manual transmission Passat with the steering wheel on the right hand side, gear shifter on the left and of course I had to stay on the proper side of the roads and intersections. Here come the impressions:

First three days can be described as horror. The left side of the road and intersections were actually the least terrifying aspects, except perhaps multilane roundabouts, where I may sometimes have not been a model driver. I was honked only three times over that period, which I consider a personal triumph. HOWEVER, the vehicle width and depth perceptions was all messed up. Right is left, left is right, everything had to be relearned. And Passat is a pretty large vehicle (should have gotten a Golf or Focus). Within 30 MINUTES I hit a trash can, dislodged the passenger (right) mirror and scratched the front quarter panel. I made a mistake of picking the car in the dusk, which meant I drove it on narrow streets of Edinburgh (to get to my hotel) after dark. It was a miracle I did not hit more. So I drove my car with passenger mirror out of alignment, but fortunately I was not using multilane roads, so it didn't matter. Other things did.
Day one - terrified of every vehicle coming from the opposite lane, including Smart
Day two - terrified of trucks and buses coming
Day three - still uncomfortable with buses.

BTW, the roads there are narrow, commonly with 10 ft or so lanes and no shoulder. On those days I ended up kissing the curb many times (as you'll naturally drift away from oncoming traffic, especially if you don't have a good feel for the width of the vehicle), but fortunately the curbs were low and the tires were high enough, so it was only an uncomfortable ""kick"", rather than all out grinding of the rims.

By day four I generally got decent handle of it, enough not to be scared all the time. I still had sometimes uncomfortable moments, when my weak left hand couldn't feel the shifter too well on gear reductions, making me slow down too much and delay taking off on some roundabouts, but it wasn't too bad, just not too smooth. Anyway, I would still avoid driving on the left side of the road in cities and after dark, but country was alright. Overall it was exhausting, though.

On other subject - the Passat (it was a diesel, rather base version, but still some decent equipment) was OK, but its entertainment and media center was completely baffling. I could not figure out a consistent way to make it play navigation directions from my phone: one time it would do nothing, another it would silence the podcast feed, but still not say anything, another time it would actually play the directions through the speakers. For the life of me, I didn't know how to make it do it every time. It was something about streaming through the USB vs. Bluetooth, but only God and Hans knew what the exact settings were.","

As it turned out, we all liked it so much that I sold my 1993 Pathfinder SE instead. I wouldn't recommend a TJ for long interstate jaunts, but for suburban driving they are fine.
I haven't spent any seat time in a JL, but from what I've read it has much more civilized on-road behavior while retaining the off-road capability that Wranglers are known for. As to amenities, the new JL can be equipped with a full set of Helen Keller ""driver's aids"" as well as LED lighting, heated seats, navigation, and a decent ""premium"" audio system.","Ah, memories of being handed the keys to a brand new Land Rover to pilot around Ireland. Highway, no problem. Little old towns and rural lanes, way too big a barge. At least that was an AT so one less thing to worry about. And built in Navi was handy. Even if it did consider goat paths usable roads. Roundabouts though, they did not bother me. Family in back seat yelling about being close to things, they get annoying.

Somehow I avoided hitting anything in 5 days. But I did get smart and not drive into Dublin.

Anyway after talking about it for about 15 minutes, Mrs. j jumps up and says something like, ""I don't want to hear anymore about getting a new car we don't need a car"" and she leaves the room putting her hands over her ears. After about and hour of talking about the cars specs from a brochure I picked up at a dealer and him looking at info online, I've pretty much convinced myself that I'm going to get one in Cabernet Read Pearl with a V8. Just have to see who has it at the right price. Like I said we discussed this car for about an hour and I remember my Son saying, ""that seems like a nice car and even though the V8 cost more, there is no sense in going half way by getting the V6"". Then he says, ""do you really think you should be spending your grandkids inheritance like that""? Too late, I had already made up my mind. I know my Son and I know he was kidding but it was humorous to me and Mrs. j when she heard about it.

Being the grandparents of 5 (4 boys and a girl), we try to have a good time with them, which of course means spending money sometimes. We don't think we over do it but we immensely enjoy watching them have a good time with what we give them. We'd rather see them enjoy it while we can still see it because we know nothing down the road is guaranteed. For us this is the way to do it but everyone has to do it their own way and I'm sure you will have some left over for your grandchildren too.

I do the same thing, JM.  When my son comes to see me, whether it’s with his SO or with one of his sons each August, I always pay for their airline tickets and I take them shopping one full day for clothes, shoes, and goodies.  It’s my way of sharing what I have with them.  We go out for dinner every night and brunch every day.  We go to the movies or do something they want to do.

I give my son $100 each month to help him with his health insurance premiums and just before he leaves to go home to Palm Desert, I give him a check for a few thousand dollars because I know he needs it.  He works 12+ hours every day and part of every Saturday.  Why not see him and my grandchildren enjoy what I provide them rather than have him spend his inheritance when I am gone.  If my surviving daughter had any kind of normal relationship with me, I would do the same for her.  I have offered to pay her way down here but she refuses.  Her loss, my son’ and grandsons”s gain!

Most importantly, it gives me pleasure!   

I wonder how he’ll (my son) react to my 2018 S450?  He will probably say, “.. enjoy the new car Dad...”!","qbrozen said:

Does their website have a carfax link? Autocheck tells me there is a ""title problem"" but no details. Their asking price is about $1500-$2k below auction value, so that is concerning.

I don't need two Genny's in the garage due to jealousy reasons but this post is VERY much on time:

Just last night as we were going out to dinner, I pull up behind a new or newer Legacy with a red pearl paint job. It really looked good compared to the blah 2012 Silver Legacy that Mrs. j has. I purposely didn't say anything because it was our anniversary and didn't want to get into it with her about cars and that hers should be replaced. I'm a dope but not that big of one, at least not on that day. It's a long light and finally Mrs. j says, ""that's a nice color on that Legacy. I guess that is the color you'd want me to get if I got a new one, huh""? Whoever said there aren't car gods is wrong because there was one in the car with us last night. Then she goes on to say, ""yeah, that's a nice color but you'd want one with two pipes under the bumper not one like that one has, right""? I still think there are car gods because she used to call them ""round things"".

Because of last night I now think I have a chance of her changing her mind about getting a new car. Yep, yesterday was a good day all around.

jmonroe","Thanks all for the anniversary wishes. We had a great dinner at a nice restaurant that we don't go to very often AND like my post above alluded to... a new car for Mrs. j may not be too far off now. It's gotta be a car god thing.

Now, I need clarification on this English talk. I was watching a bit of Downton Abbey on TV before reading this, but I'm not clear.

When ""this one takes the cake!"", is that _pound_ cake like @driver100 said the airlines gave them to compensate for their delay?","Son had a terrible time delay getting from DAY to Reagan International on Sunday evening: a couple hours weather delay.
Coming back last night again a little weather and his 7:20 flight became a 9:20 flight out. But we assumed he was on that flight, because he didn't want to change flight to an earlier flight out. Instead, this morning we learned that he had switched to a later flight because there was a problem with the 9:20 delay flight. But the 10:30 flight did an emergency landing. He said there was an ABS problem--was it made by Takata? LOL

That's all we know. I checked plane's track for last night on flightaware and it did a circle around our airport here after flying over the control tower at low altitude and low speed for almost 15 minutes. Then landed on the longer runway of the 3.

The last flight is a larger plane than the 50-seat earlier planes. OR due to delayed flights into Reagan they needed seats on the plane that left at 9:20 for connecting folks who missed earlier flights and they offered him a voucher for switching to the later flight?","
Speaking of restaurants I have a question for you far more worldly types than me.

For years I would see commercials for Applebee's on the US TV stations were receive here. Now, when I traveled into the USA over the years I tried most of the chains like TGI Fridays, Chili's, PF Chang's, Olive Garden, etc but somehow missed trying Applebee's. BTW I didn't mind Denny's when I visited there for breakfast.

About 10 years ago an Applebee's finally opened up here not far from where I worked. A few of us tried it at lunch shortly after it opened and it was... terrible. Reminded me of airline food with lots of salt and cheese added. Figured maybe they were still new so I stayed away for a few months before going back. It was the same if not worse. Got the impression everything was frozen, then microwaved and finished under a broiler or whatever. I knew it wasn't just me because after that everyone I asked who had been there said much the same thing. Sure enough it closed after a couple more years.

An “early inheritance”?  The nerve of him!  He’s actually saying that your money is his money - merely a slight constraint since you have to be deceased before he gets it.  Besides, you are leaving your money to your children, not your SIL.

I would set up a living trust with a 3rd party as the controller with a stipulation that if any money ends up in the hands of you SIL, the remainder of the trust’s assets shall be distributed to charities.","
I'd want a 2 door Wrangler as well, not a big fan of the Unlimiteds.",same for me on the Jeep. 2 door only.,"Driver, if he asked for an early inheritance, I would have told him to call his parents, see what they said. Actually, why the heck are they leasing a Mercedes for him? Buy his own car. get a job if needed.","

That is a good analysis of how bad saying such a thing is. The 3rd party trust idea is a good one....we did that, mainly to protect our daughter. I told our financial advisers about his early inheritance plan, and they laughed their heads off at it.","
Stick, he has already borrowed at least $240k from his parents and they have 8 kids....I don't think they want to give him more. He could never handle a real job, he has a company but from what I can figure out his father really owns it....I guess he knows his son. His father gives him a new leased car every 3 or 4 years. He gets a generous lease allowance, and he buys what he wants....actually his wife chooses what she wants since she is the one driving it most of the time.

It is a real case of afluenza....he has been given everything in life, so he never had to earn it. At one time I thought he had a great set up being given everything....but, all it did was makes him useless.","My father used to tell this wonderful story about inheritance.

When HIS father, my grandfather Federico, was about 75, (the old man was born in Italy and came here in his 20s) he gathered all 6 children together and announced; ""I am very ill. I will die soon. What I will do is give everything I own to the 6 of you now, --I will sell the house, the business ( hardware store in NY), everything---and in return, I will live with each of you, for a period of 6 months, starting with the oldest child. Chances are the youngest will never have to care for me"".

Well, wouldn't you know he lived to be 96---LOL!

So every Christmastime, at the big family dinner, the old man, blind, deaf, wobbly, would rise from the table, raise his glass (he could consume considerable quantities of wine and cigars) and say:

la morte mi ha tradito (Death has cheated me!)

And my dad said that one could hear, in very low muttering around the table: ""Death has cheated YOU?""","

Here is the problem stick. 80 to 90% of people are pretty honest and decent. That is what makes civilization work. Otherwise, we couldn't leave our house, business wouldn't trust businesses to pay for goods. When you get a con man involved, he knows the buttons to push that make you believe him. If she believes him, and doesn't believe us, then she has to make her choices.....I can't force her to realize he is a con man....she has to find out, and I will try to prove it to her......then she can make the decision. All I know is I want nothing to do with him.......life is good, and he is the only negative in my life....and I want him removed. (Do you know someone who could do it?)
Be careful how you approach this with your daughter as she sees him through her eyes and experiences not yours. Many people see criticism of their spouse as criticism of themselves, sort of suggesting that they make poor choices or are to sense to know things.

Also consider that there is their side of the story and that either there is a rational explanation of why they did that or that she has rationalized his actions. so that any criticism will be met with ""you just don't understand"".

Finally people do know the faults of their spouses and still love them despite those faults and any complaint about them isn't going to do any good. You also have to understand that with many people they will stand by their spouse and will take the stance that if their spouse isn't welcomed then they aren't either.

I would talk with both and let them know that I was not happy with their actions and would prefer that things like that would not happen again. Doing it in a non accusatory way, then take steps to make sure it doesn't like change codes and hide keys while away. But that's just me.

In conclusion tread carefully if you want to maintain good relations with the daughter.

A few years ago at a family wedding, they had a dance for “all the married couples.”  After a few minutes, the band asked all the couples who had been married 1 year or less to get off the dance floor, then 5, 10, 20...  My parents were the last couple dancing together having been married over 40 years.  It is something to be very proud of.

We’ve got to talk about 7,500 miles in your ownership period of your “new Genny.”  I think it is th color.  Trade that sucker in for a new Cabarnet Red V8 powered G90 and you’ll put more miles on it.  Either that or convince MRS J that she needs to ditch her Legacy for a Genny of her own.

@driver100 - Steve, I can’t believe how low your piece of trash son in law stooped.  I don’t envy your position at all.  Unfortunately I’ve learned in my short 42 years on this earth that the right thing and the easy thing are almost never the same.  You’ve put up with his crap for long enough.

@abacomike - enjoy your time with your grandson.  One thing I’ve always been thankful for is the fact that I had 2 parents and 4 grandparents growing up.  My kids too.  There really is nothing like having a relationship with your grandparent or grandchild.

You always amaze me stick with your common sense. That is an excellent plan and that will be plan B for sure.
The last time daughter emailed her mother she said we will sit down when you get back..........if that gets arranged might as well do it, if not, I would go with your plan.....which technically is better, but, there is a reason I think it is better if she initiates it.

The reason being....I said something very powerful in my email to her....I said he will mysteriously find his licence very shortly because I know him, and he won't want to apply for his license, health card, credit cards again (since he doesn't do much work anyway). Within a few days he will find his wallet. I said I have heard his stories and excuses over the years, so I know how it works. He did find it the next day. That is the first shred of evidence she actually knows about now.....so, I want to see what happens.","
That always backfires, stick.  Putting your daughter in the position of choosing her father and mother over her husband is, at the very least, problematic.","
Our 51st coming up in August.","xwesx, Great post for a few reasons.
First though, yes, he could have rented a car but the thing about the S-I-L is, he is incompetent. Our daughter leaves early in the morning and travels about 30 miles out of town for work. Maybe she was going to take the Lexus that day so he could pick up his mother in the Mercedes, that is what they usually do....though if we were here my good hearted wife usually takes his mother for the once a month eye appointment. He probably had an appointment for 11 with his 2008 Lexus, and thought they could fix it right away, but, when they told him it would take a day he only had a bit of time to find a white Mercedes GLK.

He wouldn't rent a car or take a taxi....won't spend money on things like that. Will spend $500 to go to a hockey game though.

It was a great post because you said the best approach is to let bygones be bygones. That is what I have done for about 5 years now even though he scammed us and others through our business. But, this was the final straw.....it is impossible to let bygones be bygones when someone like this who has no conscience basically steals your car. Once you let it go he will do something again....it means nothing to him, the end justifies the means as far as he is concerned.

If there is a small misunderstanding, I would agree, try to let it go, it isn't worth the aggravation, and sometimes a small thing gets blown out of proportion.

I would definitely try that first, but, I tried it for 5 years and then he pulls this whopper and thinks nothing of it.

What if I woke up with a tooth ache and my car wouldn't start? Would I go to his house and take his car? Geez, I can't imagine someone even thinking of doing it. Rent a car, take a cab, call a friend......if he could get to his mothers in a taxi he could have used her car.","



That always backfires, stick.  Putting your daughter in the position of choosing her father and mother over her husband is, at the very least, problematic.

I like sticks method. I like to present the facts as honestly as I can. Then the daughter can make her choice. That way I have done everything I possibly can do....if she still wants to believe the con man, or abuser, or good for nothing loser, then that is her choice....I won't like it, but, I can only do what I can do.","JM...congrats to you and your wife on the wedding anniversary.

Driver.....WOW! I think I would have a long, sincere and stern chat with the SIL. That’s wrong on so many levels. Your car, regardless of his relationship to you. To me, that’s a “no-no”! And, no one an blame you if you tell him in no uncertain terms how you feel.",I'm partial to letting bygones be bygones where family is concerned. Would your wife have left you if her parents wanted her to?,"
I agree; with that much history, he has pretty much said loud and clear that he has no respect for you as people; you're only another means for him. This is definitely that strong sense of entitlement I noted. It is like customers throwing an all-out tantrum with a customer service rep in a store, or a dog chasing cars. As long as you let them get away with it, they're just encouraged to keep doing it.

Case in point: I used to get into arguments with my wife because she didn't (perhaps still doesn't) like my driving policy of not stopping/swerving for dogs that run out into the road to chase cars. I'll slow for them, but I won't stop, and I won't swerve. We had lots of ""near misses"" over the years with the dogs gaining just enough sense to avert collision at the last moment. Then, a new neighbor moved in a few houses up from me with a dog that was unbelievably belligerent about car chasing, to the point that one morning one of my other neighbors almost swerved into me as I left the area for work because that dog leapt out at them and they tried to avoid it.

A few days later, we're driving home and the dog jumps out at us. I was going about fifteen. I hit it, dog bounces off the bumper, screams bloody murder, and runs away. My wife was infuriated with me at first. Later, I checked with the owners to inform them of the strike for awareness, but the dog was fine.

Never again did it chase a car. I was happy, wife was happy, and dog was happy (and alive).

Sounds like it's time to break your SIL of his sense of entitlement, and I think you might need to work with HIS parents so you all come out ahead. Tricky situation, though, so proceed slowly and, whatever you do, don't swerve.","xwesx said:

I hope that for you as well! Such relationships are so valuable. And, I wouldn't say that I am ""extremely adept."" I tend to be fairly analytical, so I just try to be practical about acting on my observations and conclusions. ASD is such a tricky ""disorder"" because that spectrum can manifest itself in so many ways; each child is different in how the condition affects them and what approaches get through. He visited several professionals when he was very young, and they all had their opinions about how best to parent them, but honestly I just felt like they were trying to make us into their personal marionettes. I appreciated the information as I gained more respect for the depth of the challenges I had to deal with day to day (which often times were just annoying/frustrating to me in the context of a ""normal child""), so it wasn't all a loss there. My son is very strong on verbal communication - he was speaking full sentences at fifteen months - but he also doesn't know when to zip it. I think he's starting to learn that now, slowly, but it puts up a major barrier to communicating with others (perhaps ironically?) because they don't want to listen to him blather on about every detail of some topic of interest to him without ever being able to get a word in edgewise! It is a particular barrier with his age group, and it doesn't help that he's typically smarter than five of them together, so his interests don't align either. It's tricky for him....
I am quite familiar with the repetitive and unending dissertation that my grandson utilizes in his communications with me on the phone - similar but not exactly perseveration.  Last year, I called him for his birthday, as I always do.  He thanked me and almost instantaneously went into quite a precise dissertation on the possibility of life on other planets or in our galaxy.  He described, in detail, what his spaceship would look like and the supplies it would have to have on board in order to prove his “hypothesis” (his word, not mine) that life exists out there in the far reaches of space (his words, not mine).

After about 25 minutes of this on the phone, I had to stop him and asked to speak with his mother.  Whew!!!

My son does not have the patience needed to work with my grandson as you do.  He concentrates more on the 17 year old boy who is on his way to college on several scholarships.  His mother is even worse, which was the major cause of his divorce.  They have shared custody, but that environment is not a healthy one for the boy.  Whatever time my son has after his 12 hour work days shortchanged his youngest son because he devotes so much time and energy for the older son.  

That’s why I am so keen on spending three straight days with my youngest grandson.

I noticed on the itinerary from American Airlines that the two of them were not seated together on the first leg of their flight home.  So I called my son to inform him that I would pay for the preferred seating on that flight so they could sit together.  Having Aspergers, I thought that sitting next to two strangers in his row of seating might be too stressful for him.  So they are now seated together on that flight.

Thanks all for your patience on this long post.  My apologies.","

However, you sobered me right up with what followed! I will admit that I had days like that. However, I also have an incredible wife who has given so much more to our son than most of us would ever give to all our children, let alone just one. She has certainly had the most positive impact on him; I just add my parts where I can. I don't always agree with her methods, and she rarely agrees with mine, but together we get it done.","

Here I go, agreeing with Monroe again. But, I give anyone who raises children who have a disability such as Aspergers a lot of credit. I found it difficult enough to cope with life just trying to get through with children who didn't have a real disability. I'd find it difficult just trying to get myself through life.

Just to be clear....I wouldn't do the severing. I did have to use tough love on youngest daughter though. She was angry about something for a long time and we had a big difference of opinion about lifestyle and values etc., I think the key in her case was saying we could have different values, opinions etc., but, still love each other. We avoid those topics and it has worked well, and she has changed to become more mainstream - and I think enjoying life more with a good paying interesting job.

But, there comes a point to where kids will take advantage. They will act out so you will give in or give them something...usually money. Sometimes, you do have to draw the line and realize that they may just be using you. Hopefully it will never get to that point."

That is a brilliant tactic xwesx. Well done.", So sorry to hear about the cat , Happy anniversary Chi Monroe to you and the wife ,"xwesx said:
As you all know, I have a keen interest in children with Autism - especially Asperger's Syndrome. One of my friends asked me if I subscribed to Netflix - and my response was that I do. He suggested I go on to Netflix and search for one of their short series entitled, ""ATYPICAL"". It is a 6 part series about a high school teenager who suffers from autism - probably with Asperger's Syndrome. It is a comedy drama series about the frustrations the boy experiences - like taking verbal comments made to him ""literally"" rather than figuratively. It includes his interactions with other 17 and 18 year olds, his mother and father, his sister and the family as a whole and how they deal with life. I found it one of the very best series I have ever viewed. I laughed at the various situations he gets himself in and out of. My eyes teared at his frustrations and insecurities. I empathized with the parents as well as sister. It is unbelievably well acted by all characters. It's a must see if you want some good laughs and some serious knowledge about these neurological disorders from the perspective of the boy, the parents, the sister and all tose he comes into contact with. In the last episode, it seems as if there will be another 7-8 episodes based upon the way it ended. Remember, ""ATYPICAL"" on Netflix.
Thanks for sharing! Sounds like an interesting one. I probably will not end up seeing it due to it being held captive behind the Netflix paywall, but good to know it is out there! We watched a movie many years back called Temple Grandin, starring Claire Danes. Also a good one, and she did a fantastic job with the role. My son has Aspberger's, and taking things literally was one thing that he did quite well. I am often being facetious, sarcastic, or just generally figurative in my speech, so I made a point of doing this around him frequently. After directing him toward my literal meaning for a few years, and always being sure to use non-verbal queues that made it more than obvious (to normal people) that I am not saying precisely what I mean, he began to pause after such statements and say, ""You aren't being serious, are you...."" Now, at fourteen, he picks up on that stuff fairly well (even if not as easily as others who do not have this ASD trait) and with anyone.
My grandson is also 14.  Since I have not been in his life for 10 years, this 3 day visit will be more of an introduction for both of us.  He knows I am his father’s Dad and understands that concept.  I would love to sit with him for a few hours to determine his differentiation between literal and figurative communication - also to determine his ability to pick up visual facial clues.

It appears from your comments, xwesx, that you are extremely adept at dealing with your son’s communication and social interaction skills deficits and continue to work hard at modeling those skills so vital in effectively teaching him communication and survival strategies in this social society.  I am envious of you.

At least my grandson is high functioning, intellectually but not verbally, which is helpful in his learning regimen.  I hope some of my advanced knowledge and significant experiences in the education of autistic and communication disordered children will assist me in hitting it off with my own flesh and blood - my grandson!","driver100 said:

jmonroe","Here is the story.....and I have to say, this guy is a complete moron....I would like to use another word but I think the auto shutoff will take over. A little long....but, weirder than a story you could make up.

Our daughter will be called A here, my wife is B and you know who gets a big X!

This happened while we were in London;

We are in London. X (son in law) has a 2008 L.e.x.u.s. on its last legs. His father's company leased him a 2015 Mercedes that his wife drives, because she is the bread winner and has to go 30 miles to work. His father thinks he is using the Mercedes that looks just like my wife's car. and it happens to be a white GLK just like my wifes car.

On Thursday just before Hamilton starts A emails that X has to take his mother to the eye doctor, his car is getting repaired, can he use my wifes car, which looks the same as A's car. Remember, his mother and father don't know my daughter is using the company car, and he is using his old Lexus every day.

We ignore her email thinking they would find another option, like renting a car.

We get another email, that X had to take his car to Lexus for a repair, they won't give him a loaner because he lost his wallet and license the day before. They decided that he would just take my wife's car. They have a key to the house for emergencies, they know the security code, and he took the car.

That to me is theft. Also, what happens if he is stopped and is driving without a licence?
If he is an accident it would go on our insurance.....except I would report the car stolen, and it would be on his insurance.

We are both really upset....they do this behind our backs while we are in England. I wrote A that they have intruded on my vacation, that I want the car returned first thing in the morning, and they have a lot of nerve taking someone's car without getting permission. I told them that car isn't just my wife's car....it is our car, and they need permission from both of us to take it, and I didn't give permission and I wouldn't give permission, and incidentally she would never give him permission.....we would probably give our daughter permission for a real situation.

Btw....I don't believe he lost his wallet. I think he wanted my wife's car because it looks like their car and if he used it his mother would think it was his car. I wrote to our daughter and said he hasn't lost his wallet, I know him too well, he is too lazy to fill out all the forms....he will have found his wallet by early in the week....I thought about Monday. I wrote that early Saturday morning.....by Saturday evening he was on Messenger....someone had returned his wallet. How did I know he would have his wallet back.....I have seen him in action for a few years.

The lock on the house will be changed and the security code has been changed. That reminds me....are those front door locks with the codes any good? We will make arrangements to see them soon....and he will be told in no uncertain terms if he comes to our house when we aren't there, or takes a car he will be charged. I am sure they will apologize profusely, probably bring flowers or a gift certificate for a restaurant and I will say I don't want it and I don't want a meaningless apology. You apologize when you spill a drink on someone.....this is in your character, that never changes, and since I don't want to deal with it any more....say hello at a family function, and move on. Our daughter who makes a lot of money can have a relationship with us, or with her mother, or not...., or if she can use this to see through him she can get out now....he won't be part of the package that I ever want to deal with again..

I should have phoned the police that there was a B&E at our house and they stole our car....here is the address where you can find it.

I second the other comment about why go to play tennis on such little rest.

Our son had to fly to Reagan National at 5 last evening. I won't mention the airline because I think it's the DC airport's fault, but this time the plane didn't leave the runway here at Dayton International until 8:44 pm. Normally it's 20-40 minutes late. He's had to fly for his business on this non-stop a few times before.

There was a miscommunication between the pilot and the gate attendant at about 7:30 and the passengers were all deplaned. Then they were reloaded apparently.

I think the airline owes them all a free ride in compensation. I'll suggest that to my son. He didn't get to bed until 12 and had to be up at 3 am to get ready and get to wherever this appointment was.

He flies home on the same airline this evening. This flight also has trouble leaving on time especially if there's any weather occurring in that area.","

It seems like your actions so far are the most reasonable approach: You made it quite clear that they leaped over a line there, and they are not welcome to do so again. In fact, you set the line a lot closer to their side of the court just to drive home that point. I'm not sure how or if you can break through that strong sense of entitlement in one-or-both of them, but my approach would be to let bygones be bygones at this point and keep an open mind for what comes next.

I have had nearly all of my siblings and siblings-in-law do something of a similar scale as this. They know what they did, and they have to live with it. I don't bring it up and don't let it play into our future interactions, but they also darn sure know that they'll never do it again or ask me for another favor unless they figure out a way to make amends now (in some cases this means a decade or two down the road from when it occurred....). Overall, I much prefer to have the relationship than worry/fume over what was lost.","
I thought about that after I wrote "" he is the only negative in my life....and I want him removed. (Do you know someone who could do it?)""

I'd suggest a Ford discount might be more likely. I was amazed when we'd visit friends living in the Canton/Plymouth upscale area and there were so many Lincolns on the road and in the driveways.

We're still needing to see 'Longmire' season 6. We've watched seasons 1-5 already and love the series. That series may not be back, which would be a shame, for sure. It's about a sheriff who's honest and tough and strong, his two remaining deputies and their lives, plus an adjoining Indian reservation and Indian-run Casino that keep his Sheriff's office hopping. The crime on the nearby rez intertwines with the crime in Absaroca County and it's never a dull moment. Once you get ta know the characters Absaroca County-wide, the show becomes extremely interesting and also addicting.","
Great show. But yes, Longmire has ended its run. Recommended. One of my favorite shows of the last ten years, although the very last episode I was a little bit mixed about—but that's all I'll say.","Anyone watch Power on Starz?

I watched a a number of episodes, but I found it difficult to keep up with.  Very dark drama and, as you mentioned, quite violent.

I enjoy some action and violence, but more like “Reds” and “Reds 2” as well as the “Mission Impossible” flicks with Tom Cruise where they mix in some humor along with the suspense.  Like the James Bond movies also because there is a mix of suspense, humor, drama and violence.

This jealousy probably stems from when his old Benz was rear ended and totaled and no one commented on the rentals he had.

As for getting a Maxima, Mrs. j is far from being a car person and if I suggested doing that she wouldn't know what I was talking about but if I said I was interested in a Benz she at least would know what that was.

Sorry for your loss.
In the eye of the law animals are property (USA, anyway), but we know that is not the case.","I am 3 payments away from having the Accord paid off , and we are paying extra on the Pilot to pay it off early. The goal is to have both paid off by this October. Though I pine for a new car, it will be great to have them paid for.","
Having fun? Did you get to attend the woman's finals? That sounded like an exciting match. Not that I watch tennis.","
out of curiosity I ran an amortization schedule on my Elantra. If I target the 3 year point to pay off the balance that should be easy to do. I normally never want a loan longer than that anyway. Plus, it makes the ""should I lease or buy"" question an easier comparison, since the terms are equal. You just end up at 3 years with a paid off car worth whatever you can get for it, vs. nothing! Right now, just based on Edmunds, even though i only put ~ $1,000 down on it, I am pretty much even on it.

doing some quick math, and estimating a very aggressive lease payment (I never actual ask for a lease quote when I was buying), I am paying about $100/month more on the loan, so about $3,600 over the life of the loan. Adding that to the principal balance after 36 payments, and adjusting for the tax and DMV due at the end of a lease (to buy out), my purchase is roughly equivalent to if I had leased it and was able to buy it at the end for ~ $11,500. Pretty sure a low mile, pristine Sport should be worth more than that at the time (or at least, would have trouble finding a better car deal for that money!) And that the residual on a lease would be higher.

or I could sell it long before then!","Thanks to everyone for the kind words about Fred. He really was a great cat. I've had many over the years and he is one of the top two among all of them. Now I just have Rusty, who is a fine cat but not the same sort of personality.

It was a very tough day as it was totally unexpected and the circumstances (I won't go into the details) were fairly gruesome. If there is anything good that happened, it was that I discovered him in distress around 2:15PM and immediately called his vet. They closed at 2:00 but there vet who had been treating him was still there closing up, saw my name come up on the phone, and answered. After a short discussion she had me bring him in even though she had no help there. She stayed with me there until almost 4:00 there dealing with things. She could just as easily not bothered to answer the phone.

Thought I'd share that with you guys for a chuckle.","As you all know, I have a keen interest in children with Autism - especially Asperger's Syndrome. One of my friends asked me if I subscribed to Netflix - and my response was that I do. He suggested I go on to Netflix and search for one of their short series entitled, ""ATYPICAL"". It is a 6 part series about a high school teenager who suffers from autism - probably with Asperger's Syndrome. It is a comedy drama series about the frustrations the boy experiences - like taking verbal comments made to him ""literally"" rather than figuratively.

Ha ha I think you have a guilty conscience Mr. Monroe. Yet in the end you DID call him up. I hope you weren't breathing heavy.","I posted a couple of times in the last few weeks about the fiasco with ""SUNPASS"", the system the State of Florida uses to collect tolls on all of its toll roads using a transponder. Well, finally, they got their website and mobile App working as of yesterday. I checked all the tolls they charged against my account and I noticed all of June and most of July tolls have not been billed. Why? Because their multi-million dollar system crashed the first day they implemented it back at the beginning of June. So, I estimated that I spent about $30 using the Turnpike the past 6 weeks that will not be collected or charged because of the ""technical"" issues with the new system. I wonder how many millions of dollars the Toll Road Administration will have lost over this mess. Astonishing that the media did not get a hold of this for those 6 weeks - they seem to cover just about everything else - how come not one media outlet (newspapers, TV, Radio) covered this?

If we incline too much to democracy we shall soon shoot into a monarchy, or some other form of a dictatorship"" Alexander Hamilton.

Yeah, never quite got or understood the ""maniac"" part. I just assume they got somewhere to be. It doesn't offend my ego when someone passes me, which will almost always be on the left if I can help it (sometimes you do go into Lemming mode in the passing lane in very heavy traffic), but 99% of the time I'm yielding to faster traffic. I have hope their front bumper is more intimidating than mine to the guy in front impeding traffic (and hope they'll be a more aggressive tailgater too). There are go-getters, and there are Lemmings. Go-Getters don't do Lemming well. By the way, some commutes are pretty long for many people. I have 30 miles to cover, I could easily get a few miles ahead of you, especially if I caught one light you didn't before getting on the freeway. Yes, the chances of an accident in that short span are low, but they are possible. I've encountered bad wrecks where I was early enough on scene that traffic hadn't gone haywire yet, and law enforcement hadn't bottle-necked the situation even worse yet. So while I was only slowed down 2 or 3 minutes at most, the people 3 miles back might be slowed down 10 times more.
Why am I not surprised that you don't understand the maniac part. Everyone has someplace to be, most people plan accordingly. my ego isn't hurt by someone passing me either, it's just that I don't understand the mentality that going faster saves so much time when in reality it doesn't ( especially in heavy rush hour traffic). 

The average commute in the US is just over 25 minutes, only a small percentage have 30 miles or more to commute. My 12.5 mile commute comes in at about that 25 minute time. Now if the two of us drive that commute at the same time with you going as fast as you can and me doing speed limit I will guarentee you that after 11.5 miles you will be able to see me in your rearview mirror. 

As for the lights, the ones you can make by speeding I will also make doing speed limit. The lights I will get caught by so will you, you will just get to them sooner. Those lights you usually have to sit through at least one cycle before getting through.

Seriously the only way that I can make this commute any faster is by leaving a lot earlier or by taking my motorcycle and split lanes. Try this, drive your commute and don't exceed the speed limit and see how much time you really save.","andres3 said:
Actually, the Solomon curve goes parabolically higher and steeper on the slower side than the faster side (slightly). And in fact, going slightly over the average flow is the bottom of the curve, not zero. Lastly, weaving is a symptom of a disease. That disease is left lane camping. Eradicating left lane camping makes weaving extinct, among many other undesirable behaviors. Speed differential hazards are almost wiped out if you have lane discipline and strict adherence to passing laws. The reason speed differentials are so hazardous in the USA is because of our poor adherence to lane laws as a group of people.
There is a flaw with the Solomon curve, that is it didn't take into account accidents involving vehicles that had slowed down to negotiate a turn. Subsequent studies have supported Solomon but several (I will try to find one) found that around 45% of ""slower"" moving vehicles were originally traveling with or above the flow of traffic and had only slowed down to turn off the road. When they adjusted their findings for this the bottom of that curve moves away from that slightly faster than average that you proport.

As for weaving being a symptom, it does take two to tangle. While not defending LLC'ing weaving is also a symptom of fast aggressive driving.","andres3 said:

Back in the days of the asinine 55 mph NMSL I regularly drove 80-85 mph on rural interstates. With the help of a 1st generation Escort and a CB I never received a ticket- or got pulled over for that matter. When I came up on a clump of slower vehicles I matched their speed and worked my way though the pack with as little drama as possible. That way I didn't antagonize the slow drivers. Now that the speed limits on limited access roads are usually 70 mph or better, I still drive 80-85, it's a comfortable speed that doesn't attract the attention of law enforcement- especially since I'm usually far from the fastest car on the road.
Back in the 55 MPH days I got nabbed for going 80+ somewhere out west. The fine was $5 and I could pay the officer. The officer told me that they had to show that they were enforcing the SL but were giving out token fines.

Why are all the cars going the same speed in all lanes? I would ticket every single one of them not in the right-most lane! EVERY-Single-One! They all deserve it. Mob mentality isn't good. Exception: No one is moving at all, bumper to bumper stop n' go.
Unfortunately a highway can only accommodate a finite number of cars and still maintain a smooth flow of traffic. During rush hour far more cars attempt to use highways than they can accommodate at a normal flow. This slows down traffic sometimes to a crawl with all lanes filled doing very close to the same speed. In this situation would you ticket all the thousands of cars? To do so would make the situation worse.","I've watched the aggressive driving of speeders who tailgate if someone isn't going quite as fast as they'd like in the left most lane of 3 and up freeways. They are the ones who aggressively switch lanes to the right and sometimes meet a driver merging left from lane 1 into #2, e.g..

I used to have to drive into Cincinnati for medical visits monthly for a time and I loved setting the appointment at 9:00 or so meaning I would get to drive 55 or 60 in the rightmost lane of 3 and more with the trucks and others. But I watched the other drivers in the then 3 lane interstate jockey for their ego positions in the traffic filling the 3 lanes where a lot of folks from Dayton area commute southward to Middletown and Cincinnati.

The folks who were truly in a hurry didn't spend time trying to bolster their ego by tailgating someone going 69 in traffic in the leftmost lane of 3 or 4. They carefully passed on the right if they thought there were enough spacing there to get around the errant driver in the left most lane.

If a driver was in the leftmost lane going below the speed limit, all bets were off.","roadburner said:

I do think that ticketing someone in a steel cage with crumple zones and air bags and other safety equipment for not wearing a seat belt and giving a pass to a motorcyclist who has none of those safety features and is exposed that's not wearing a helmet a pass is hypocrisy.","My observations over years are that if I'm in my Chevy Cobalt in the leftmost lane of I75 or I70 going 5 over the speed limit and I do not move over as the speeding driver thinks I should, they will tailgate more aggressively than if I'm in my Malibu, a larger car. Note, there is traffic in the 1 and 2 lanes to my right, sometimes with trucks who are speed limited to 60 or 63. Note, I get over when there is a long space where I don't have to make a lane change back left to be able to keep my speed above the limit. OR this is through the 3 miles or so of urban Dayton traffic.

I also noted before I traded it for the Malibu that driving my leSabre, the 03 red one, also made me a target for more aggressive tailgating. The FOP and NRA stickers on the rear window didn't seem to slow down the stereotyping that a Buick driver was different than an Accord or Civic driver.

Do the cars make a difference in the treatment from the 5% of aggressive drivers who are left-laning?

Does the car being driven by the smaller percentage of aggressive drivers make a difference?"

jmonroe",I think those posts also qualify for the 'Most Words Skipped' trophy.,"We have 6 zones and 3 are in-floor radiant with a fairly open floor plan.   The installer said that since the water is merely warm in the radiant tubes, it doesn't work well to use a setback thermostat since it takes too long to get the room up to temp.  Instead, it is easy to maintain the temp.  In winter, main room is set to 66, bedroom to 64 and master bath to 68.  So, plain old thermostats for me. 
For AC we just have a single heat pump mini-split unit that keeps most of the house comfortable with judicious use of ceiling fans and a floor fan. We also use this during the ""shoulder"" season on chilly days before the heating season really kicks in. ","My wife is turning into Big Brother. The new house we bought had a Nest camera installed to view the front door and porch. She has since bought three more cameras - one for the main hallway, another for the living room, and a third for the back porch. Primarily to see what the dogs are up to when nobody is home, but it's creepy knowing she can watch me at certain points throughout the house, as I work from home.

We do have a programmable thermostat, but it's not a Nest. Still fiddling with the settings, even after being here a couple of months. I'm sure we will need to futz with it when winter comes, as well.","












You run the risk of having a bad neighbor in a house too. About the only way to shield yourself from a bad neighbor is with either a tall fence or a lot of distance. 

Except in a condo you can't build that fence and that bad neighbor may share a wall or a ceiling with you. Theny may also cook foods that produce odors that will leach through your walls.

Our house is cbs so it retains the cool/cold weather for a few days. Luckily, this past winter was cool for us and the a/c was off a good deal of the time. Just like with the rainy season in full force, the sprinklers are in the off position and the lawn is a nice shade of green.

Being a warm blooded type, I tend to ignore heated seats. When I was selling the Cadillac DeVille a few years back, people kept asking me if the heated seats work. My answer, ""What do you care, we're in Texas."" Turns out, they did work.

My favorite story about heated seats, which I've probably shared before. Shortly after I bought my 2015 F150 (very nicely equipped), I had a dinner date with a lovely young thing. When we were pulling away from the restaurant, she said something about feeling cold. I replied, ""No problem, I'll turn on the heat.""

Before I could do so, she said, ""Never mind, I'll just turn on the heated seat.""

I opened my mouth to tell her that my truck wasn't THAT fancy, but before I could get the words out, she had already turned on the heated seat. Sometimes it's a good idea to keep your mouth shut.","

Does that apply to repeatedly talking about getting speeding tickets? Not you but somebody else we know.

Nah, I'm much tamer on 2 and 3 lane roads than the 4, 5, and 6 lane wide freeways I'm on every day. With so many lanes available to me, it is quite easy to both weave and be safe and considerate to others.

However, I often have to wonder why someone that is part of slower traffic (and I don't just mean compared to me, but many others as well) thinks it's OK to be 4 lanes away from where they should be. My conclusion is brain dead; zombies.

It's bad enough the truckers avoid the right-most lane, mostly probably due to bad merges by bad drivers. Still, they are only 1 lane away from where they should be... how does one explain being 4 lanes over with no other traffic around them? I need to get a dash cam and post some greatest hits.

What I'm doing must be working, because unlike @graphicguy I may get the tickets, but I'm not getting into any accidents, especially at-fault accidents. All the near misses tend to happen at 0-10 MPH too.

For those that say speeders are so dangerous they will eventually impede traffic... I've been driving nearly 25 years now, just when will I cause a wreck that impedes traffic?

Are there any here that consider all rear-end collisions unsafe speed violations? I view them as failure to yield errors usually due to distraction. You can rear-end someone at 1 MPH.","
Me too, (regarding cops and hyper vigilance) I watch out for them diligently, but I'm too old to worry about it. I have many lawyers happy to take my business now.

If they want to pull me over, pull me over. Have at it. Just write it quick and try to spare me a condescending lecture. A warning? Even better; I'll appreciate that. Never got mad at a cop for a warning. Used to get mad at those that wrote citations. NO longer. I realize now with widom it isn't personal.

Most likely, 8 out of 10 Officer's in the Department wouldn't have pulled me over under the same set of circumstances, I just draw the bad apples. The CHP has gotten better lately (knocking on wood).","

Must be one of those brain-dead zombies I mentioned in a previous post!","
I'd be more OK with a speed tax than the current farce masquerading as safety.

Also, if is point A to point B time based speed tax, there are other ways to not cross the finish line too soon to trigger any red flags.","
You mean you use the HOV Lane as a passing lane, and JUSTIFY that somehow? Boy, you really do feel entitled, don’t you?","
I suppose, my tax money paid for those lanes after all. My borrowing them for a few seconds doesn't slow anyone down or put anyone out. This only works if the lane is wide open in the ""open/merging"" section, which of course is why there are no double yellows.

I just don't feel safe behind an LLC. I either have to move right, pass right, or preferably, pass left. Even worse, if someone is an LLC, I consider them to likely be a reckless driver, so I don't want to be anywhere near them any longer than I have to be.

Yeah, I agree. I do recall going through Ohio or Indiana on I-90 a while ago, which is a toll road. They actually had signs up that noted you would pay a higher toll if you reached up-road toll stations too quickly. I don't recall the thresholds, but it was reasonably generous.","
Last time we were driving through the Portland (OR) area, nearly every single vehicle in the ""HOV"" lane had only one occupant. I actually left that lane because it was moving more slowly than the standard left lane. Plus, mine seemed to be the only car with multiple people in it (in the HOV lane), and I felt less annoyed not driving with all those other entitled yahoos.","

Decided to upgrade my ancient iPhone5. I like the small form factor so went with a new sealed box iPhone SE from Amazon which seemed a good value. More accurately, fulfilled by Amazon from a 3rd party vendor. It was listed as factory unlocked. It arrived today, sealed and new as advertised, but that was about all. I should have had my first clue when the thing was DOA out of the box due to a dead battery. Plugged it in and the battery was totally flat but began to charge and eventually it turned on. Started the setup and it asked me for a SIM. Odd since everything I read said that you didn't need a SIM. No problem, I popped it out of my old phone and inserted it in the new one. No dice - it says it is not compatible and that I need to go to my carrier to have them unlock the damn phone (I added the ""damn"" part)! Contacted the vendor thru Amazon so we shall see.

Well, according to an email I received last week, I was supposed to be able to retrieve my balance and get copies of my paid tolls starting Sunday.

This interminable back-and-forth regarding driving over the speed limit and/or hogging the left lane makes it quite apparent that most of the people on here live in crowded metro areas and get little or no opportunity to drive on uncrowded rural roads. Go west, young (or otherwise) man, but not too far -- the Pacific states suck close to the coast, but not so much a bit East. Either way, my policy (FWIW) is to go with the flow of traffic, even if it's 15 mph over the limit or five below -- to do otherwise is more trouble than it's worth, in my world. All the lanes are full -- calm down and listen to your audio system. When there is no other traffic visible, go for it. Set the cruise control at 105 (some of the new ones don't even allow this) and drive for a half hour (in rural [yeah, I know is there anything else] New Mexico) on a Sunday morning. Even in Germany, in metro areas the traffic fills all lanes. It's necessary to get away from the cities and/or daytime traffic for the lane discipline that we all enjoy over there to take effect.

I think the proof is in the pudding. When I was 16 until I was about 30, I had amassed enough traffic violations and fender benders to keep the traffic courts awash in Benjamins.

I think I single handedly kept one particular repair shop in business and probably sent the owner on a cruise at least once per year. If it weren’t for a family lawyer, I may have had spent time incarcerated.

However, as these things go, the older and more experienced I got, the fewer infractions (and accidents) I had. I have not had a ticket, nor an accident charged to me in 25 years.

Kinda proud of that. But, I don’t think I’ve slowed down any. Probably much better at paying attention and missing other cars on the road. I now know where the speed traps are (and yes, even the ones tracked by air). I now know when the local constanbulary is out in fore, and where. I can now recognize, and keep my distance from, driving idiots.

The last encounter I had was a few years ago where some old dude was doing 15MPH in a 40 MPH zone. I flashed him a couple of times, which caused him to slow down to 10 MPH. I tried to pass him on the left, legally, which caused him to drift to the left to keep me from passing. Finally, I actually passed him illegally on the right as he was clearly stupid, on drugs or drunk. Unfortunately, there was a local cop a few cars behind who observed the whole thing. He lit up both of us.

Long and short of it, the guy was on drugs (middle of the day) and pretty obstinate with the cop. He was cuffed. I was allowed to go my merry way with a stern warning.

If you know where you’re going, if traffic warrants it, if you’re familar with the roads, then I flaunt the speed limit quite often, and usually well in excess of what’s customary. I’m always aware of the possibility of police trying to add to the locale’s coffers, so am cautious around areas that look like perfect places for police to hide, and to markings on the road where someone above could clock me.

What I think is extremely dangerous are cops who hide at night, with their lights off, pulled ver on a berm or a median. They can’t be seen, are trying to hide (assuming on purpose so they can’t be discovered until the last minute) in order to catch scofflaws. This is a very dangerous and unnecessary practice.

My other pet peeve, DUI check points. I don’t drink and drive, period. I think the check points are a terrible waste of money for very little ROI. If someone is stupid enough to get caught drunk at a check point, it shouldn’t be too difficult to nail them without the checkpoint. And, the habitual offenders, the ones the cops already know about, are easy enough to find.

That's instead of pursuing and stopping the cars, where they might find the all too common no driver license, no insurance valid, drunk or under influence of other drugs, warrants for the driver and/or passengers, no valid license plate on the car, usw.

Dayton also turned back on their money-making red light cameras in certain locations after the Supreme Court had reversed some requirements making it next to impossible for locals to use these moneymakers.

Yes and yes. Many young gods in cars that were somewhat spec'd up, usually with wings and flares. Immortal, superior, absolutely unconcerned about safety of their own and others.

A gap between two cars going 70 mph meant for them it's something they had a license to go into without any consideration of other peoples' comfort, sense of safety, or simple courtesy.

The town is called New Miami which is about 15 miles from me. It's a small town....about 2,000 population. The revenues they derived from the red light cameras totaled about $3M. It had been operating for a few years.

As a result, millions of dollars from the red light camera need to be refunded to whomever paid the fines. That amount would set the area into bankruptcy since they increased spending significantly in anticipation of the red light camera windfall. Guess they didn't save up for that eventuality .

Last I heard, given the red light manufacturer shared in the profits, the town was trying to tie them in to share the refund burden since they also shared the profits. The manufacturer told the city they could not afford to share the burden without going bankrupt themselves.

The court ruling has most of the areas around me backing off of red light cameras.",We had some near me in jersey but they were taken out a few years ago. I think Philly though keeps adding them.,"

About 20 years ago, I was sitting in a line of traffic, waiting on a red light. The car behind me bumped into me, and stayed in contact. A very slight bump, no damage, but a little weird. I got out of my car, checked for damage, of which there was none as our bumpers did line up. I walked back to speak to the driver. He was unresponsive, would not acknowledge me. Staring straight ahead, not moving. But his face was pale, and sweaty.

By this time the light had changed, people were honking their horns, and I was really unsure what to do. I couldn’t just drive off, my car was the only thing holding his car in place. I wasn’t sure whether we needed an ambulance or a LEO or both. Fortunately, a police car came along and I was able to flag him down. He opened the door, put the car in park, turned off the ignition, and called for an ambulance. I never did find out whether the guy was sick or drugged, but he was completely unresponsive through all of this. Eyes open, but unresponsive. Definitely a weird experience.","

The steering is numb and overboosted, the 4 cylinder feels overtaxed, and I can't seem to find a very comfortable driving position. Handling is also middling at best, even for a car based CUV (IMO). 33K hard miles may also have something to do with it as the car is fairly beat up on the sight with scratches, small dents, and scuffs on the wheels. The controls are immediately recognizable as GM (it looks like a friends older Terrain) but they are relatively straightforward and all fall easily within my reach. Also a lot of hard plastics as well on the surfaces that you see/touch the most.

I have to assume this is the base model, which was still fairly well equipped with all power equipment, satellite radio, heated cloth seats, etc and that the higher trims with the 6 cylinder and presumably more luxurious touches may change my opinion.",Isn’t the 2018 Equinox quite different?,"I have no idea, not really familiar with GM at all.

Most definitely, berri.  It’s a matter of heavy traffic in the larger cities.  Urban highways are more parking lots than roads.

I live in the northern part of Broward County where traffic is fairly light on the Turmpike.  But I-95 is quite jammed until you approach Boca Raton.  Same for I-95 in the Palm Beaches.

I see recklessness as more of a symptom stemming from ignorance, lack of experience, and road rage/anger of course.

You know what causes an unusual amount of deaths? Not wearing your seat belt. The laws have worked on that, compliance is extremely high. A very small percentage disobey seat belt laws. However, that very small percentage that disobey seat belt laws really get more than their fair share of fatalities. Maybe ""fair"" isn't the right word here. They disproportionately expose themselves to hazards, which I think if they knew the stats, they wouldn't take the risks.","



I’ve been reading the last several pages of posts regarding speed of vehicles on interstates or highways.  I’m having a problem wrapping my head around the rationale(s) proffered for driving significantly over the speed limit.

I drive a 10 mile round trip segment of the Florida Turnpike just about every morning and I fail to understand why drivers are going 75-80 mph in moderate traffic, zig-zagging in and out of the 3 traffic lanes.  The speed limit is 65 mph, but I can agree that 70 mph is an acceptable stretch of that 65 mph limit.  

I drive a car that would have no difficulty running at 90 mph safely on any well-paved multi-lane Highway, but why would I want to do 90, or 80 or even 75 in a 65 zone?  Unless all the traffic is moving at high speed as on the German Autobon, it is irresponsible to jeopardize the lives of drivers observing the speed limit or 5 mph over the speed limit.  

To take the psition that a driver can travel 15-20 mph over a posted speed limit because he or she “can” is dangerous and very suspect!  I see it every day on the Turnpike.  When I drive up to see my brother near Jacksonville, I drive at a steady 75 mph on roads that have a posted 70 mph limit.  Why is it necessary to drive at 80 or 85 mph?  It places all drivers on the road in jeopardy due to inconsiderate speeders.

If I lived in Montana, The Dakota’s or other rural areas of rural States where there is no posted speed limit, I might consider going 80 or 90 mph so long as all the traffic was moving at that speed.  But I refuse to place my life and the lives of others in jeopardy because of speeds significantly above the posted limit.

Question 1) How long has it been since you've been to CA? I have the lemmings here trained to do 80-85 routinely in 65 zones. Of course, with 5 lanes of width, you can have plenty of separation for those that go slower.

Question 2) Can you accept that many might find 75-80 to be a perfectly acceptable speed in moderate traffic despite the low 65 MPH speed limit? Not everyone will ever agree on the right speed, and that's why we have passing lanes.

Question 3) You do realize the Autobahn does have slower traffic, including trucks? The difference is they keep right except to pass; that's all. Germans are not genetically superior human drivers. They are not born that way. The system works. It's not theory; it's been practiced and proven to work in the real-world.

Question 4) How do speed deltas of 20 MPH or less really jeopardize lives? Does everyone here realize that the force of a collision between an Audi doing 120 MPH and a BMW doing 100 MPH is the same as the 20 MPH moving Prius rear-ending you at a red-light that you are stopped at? Okay, assuming the Prius was just as heavy.

Just my thoughts for the day. I think minor speed deltas can coexist safely in an orderly driving world.","On the subject of seat belts, I am not a big proponent of mandatory use of seat belts.

Yes, they save lives. Yes, I’m using mine. Yes, they should be mandatory for kids. But if an adult wants to risk his life by not wearing a seat belt, I’m not really in favor of making that behavior illegal. With apologies to the motorcycle enthusiasts here, riding a motorcycle is inherently much more dangerous than driving a car without wearing a seat belt. Are you going to make it illegal to ride a motorcycle?","
Unfortunately we disagree again. And I'm pretty Libertarian, but here's why your 100% wrong:

1) Competent, reasonable, and prudent people expect you to be able to maintain control and execute mitigating maneuvers in an emergency situation, a situation that might involve impacts. Yes, collisions, plural. The first hit might not be the hardest or most deadly!

2) How in the world are you going to maintain reasonable driver control over your vehicle if you are KNOCKED OUT OF YOUR SEAT because your too stupid to wear a seat belt.(not you personally, but for those that would do so).

3) An example would be if someone hit you, and knocked you over a cliff because you couldn't be bothered to touch the brakes or turn the steering wheel because your head is halfway through the windshield. Not so bad if they are by themselves? What if they have kids in the back seat? What if they hit another car and take them over the cliff with them?

4) I'm afraid the seat belt is pretty much as important as anything to keep you in a position to effect movement and control over your vehicle. This is something I probably didn't realize to the extent I have until HPDE training. You are in control of a 3,000+ pound object traveling potentially at high speeds, I think it is fair of society to ask that you take precautions to remain in control of it in less than ideal circumstances.

5) What about unnecessary medical bills society has to pay for because someone chose no seat belt or no helmet?","
But the taxpayer might have to foot some of the medical bills. Being mangled in a car wreck rarely involves just the one person.

And besides, driving is a privilege, not a right. So if one wants the privilege, he/she has to play by the rules.","well, we have no gubbermint sponsored health care, so they will be on their own.","
Why are all the cars going the same speed in all lanes? I would ticket every single one of them not in the right-most lane! EVERY-Single-One!

They all deserve it. Mob mentality isn't good. Exception: No one is moving at all, bumper to bumper stop n' go.","Unless you're too poor to pay. Hospitals HAVE to take you and treat you. So when the ER room screws that ""rebel"" motorcyclist's head back on his body, it's possible we're all going to foot the bill.",I got a speeding ticket by camera in the mail last week.  36 mph in a 25 mph zone.  Camera automatically snaps your pic if you are traveling 11 miles per hour over the posted limit or more.  $50 fine.  No points.  I’m pretty sure the City of New York DOT takes AMEX.,"And that's what it is all about. No doubt there's an underfunded pension in need of rescue.
","
I think seat belt and helmet laws-along with pedestrian safety standards for vehicles-are an unwarranted and inadvisable interference with the law of natural selection.","Just get fixed up and declare bankruptcy via medical bills. Only developed place in the world where such a thought is even remotely possible (yet another HDI failure).
","
If the frequency of collisions goes up (rate up), and people are still dying, it would be possible deaths would not go down.

For example, a reduced speed might lower the fatality per collision rate, but if collisions rise too high it could more than offset that rate decrease. The problem with speed limits is they are not that effective at controlling driving/travel speeds.

My opinion is simple, we know other cultures get better results than our USA experiment on driving, why not model the better systems?","Motorcycles already have more stringent licensing standards than cars, at least in first world states. Riding a bicycle or walking along a road is more dangerous than driving without a seatbelt too, outlaw those? Smoking and eating 2 Big Macs a day is also more dangerous than driving without a seatbelt, outlaw those?

Another idea, get in a crash without being belted, have your insurance rates go crazy for awhile.

","



To be fair, you are unlikely to take out other innocent victims with your Big Macs. I can see scenarios where accidents are deadly or not deadly to the driver not wearing a seat belt, but result in someone else, another innocent victim being involved, injured, or killed because of a minor accident that caused unbolted driver to lose control because they were not buckled up. The Prius knocked my hands off the wheel excuse.

2nd hand smoke was shown to hurt other people, and got smoking nearly banned; at least in CA.

I suppose that you could argue 2 Big Macs a day increase the likelyhood of a medical emergency WHILE YOUR DRIVING a 3,000+ pound vehicle","

How does NY get around the ""innocent until proven"" guilty standard, and do they have sufficient evidence you were the driver?

Just a question, have you ever seen someone weave through multiple lanes of freeway with no letting up with no other cars around? And if so,any that were not drunk?

I think the answer shows what we all know, that weaving is a reaction to a cause. We just don't want to acknowledge the real cause sometimes. It's easier to blame the effect than the cause.

Lots of states don't treat speeding and other minor infractions as criminal cases, meaning that the constitutional safeguards don't apply. The goal is revenue collection.

In Kentucky you can still request a jury trial for any traffic infraction, and the fines and the majority of court costs go to the state- meaning there is no financial incentive to convict.

No, not true. Or at the very least, not universally true. My morning commute takes me up the 288 Freeway, which then splits into I45 and I69. The left 2 lanes go into I45 for a short run, which then splits between Northbound and Southbound.

The rightmost lane goes into I69 South. The next lane over (second from the right) goes into I69 North. People who want to wind up on I45 Northbound, and know what they're doing, get in the left most lane a good mile or two before the split. Some mornings, I45 is backed up and the left two lanes of 288 are slower than the right two lanes. Some morning, I69 is backed up and the right two lanes of 288 are slower.

The ""hurry hurry hurry, beat everyone to work by 2 minutes"" crowd go plowing through traffic, jumping lanes, trying to get a 1 car advantage. They disrupt traffic flow for everyone, and cause the majority of accidents that I have seen in my 8 years of commuting on this route.

Now when I set out for San Antonio ( a 3 hour drive), I do get annoyed at left lane campers. There is a stretch of about 100 miles in there with nothing, and I do mean nothing. Just a divided interstate highway, 2 lanes westbound, 2 lanes eastbound. When I get caught behind 2 cars side by side doing 65, when the majority of the cars want to move at around 75 to 80, yes, that is annoying. But there is no ""weaving"", there is no way to weave, no place to weave.

And I will repeat my initial statement: If you are driving 20 mph faster than the average of the traffic around you, YOU are a danger, to yourself and others. And that is NOT the fault of left lane campers.","
But you called the ""hurry hurry 20 over"" speeders a ""crowd"" Isn't fair to say if they are a crowd, perhaps the average is only 10 below them, not 20? We're not talking lone wolf are we?

Let's concede for a moment that going 10-20 over the adjacent lane is a danger. Even so, does forcing them to weave right to pass sound like a good solution? That just makes the fastest traffic interact more closely with the slowest traffic. This is why we have left/right driving conventions in the first place. A camper is MAXIMIZING speed differentials, while a speeder is only doing whatever differential they prefer to do.

What you describe with multiple freeways going multiple directions all in a tiny space is pretty rare. I know LA has that with the I5 north. Still, some of these ramps are 2 lanes, and I often find a slowpoke choosing the left-most lane on a ramp; slowing everyone behind them. A Que of 20 or 30 cars, with 1/2 mile of empty space in front of them.

I'm always looking far up ahead (good driving habit). I'm always analyzing traffic patterns, both passively and actively. Most of the time the slower traffic is caused by a few bad apples.","
By accident I think you hit on the real reason why @MIke doesn't want to have me as a visitor. He's probably afraid I'll talk him to sleep and then snatch his keys and give his Benz a good joy ride. Again, I don't think you are savvy enough to have figured this out but @Mike probably is.

jmonroe","Until there is a cure for human nature, most drivers will continue to believe that they rank in the top 5% as far as driving skills are concerned, myself included. Like Rain Man, I am an excellent driver.","
You just keep digging. ""Crowd"" means here number of people nationwide. One bozo like that per per half mile is already a crowd for 10 mile commute. I'm not defending left lane campers, especially on non-busy roads, but give me a break, man. I heard it all, self-proclaimed ""fast, but safe"" people, absolutely convinced of their own superiority of driving skills, reflexes, abilities and most importantly convinced that the only thing that counts is sense of their own ""time savings"", the heck with everybody else's comfort or safety.

Let me be blunt - who cares if you ""can"" do faster (and safe) and jump two lights over another guy, feeling, oh so superior, saving in aggregate one hour per month (or week, whatever). Slow down and give us all the break. Or that cop that stops you for ""unjustified"" offence - I'll applaud him, no matter how indignant you feel.","
The problem is, if I may be blunt, that SLOW = SAFE FAST = DANGEROUS is a VERY LOW IQ thought process, to steal a Trump-ism. It's not that simple.

It's as if you think and have that attitude that the speed limit is this magical speed at which your car has the force field and shields of the Starship Enterprise, and no one can collide with you, and you can collide with no one at the speed limit. It is a magically safe speed (despite being fully arbitrary), and you can't break any laws while adhering to the speed limit. You are an omnipotent GOD if you adhere to the speed limit, and everyone else is a suicidal maniac. This type of passive aggressive ""know it all/judgmental"" behavior has no place on the road way.

I don't think people value their time more than comfort or safety. Some drivers that go too fast for conditions (an entirely different issue to speeding in and of itself) are indeed a hazard. Simple speeding is not.

The worst thing you can do is force a ""bozo"" or whatever name-calling you wish to apply (maniac?) to the right to pass slower traffic on the left. Slow pokes obeying the law in the correct and right lane will be just as mad at you as the maniacs. Every time I witness a left lane impediment violation/infraction, the offending vehicle could have EASILY moved right to allow passing. I just never see that ultra rare occurrence where someone is passing a long line of trucks at a delta of 5 with no room to move right, and the guy behind is just being an impatient maniac. That's just NOT what I'm observing out there, the vast majority of the time.

The truth is the slower pokes will REACT EXACTLY like a super speeder to being impeded in the passing lane. It's human nature. Slower pokes get impeded by the slowest pokes. Mild speeders get impeded by speed limit abiders, and so on and so forth. We all react the same to that, and we all will pass on the right when impeded like that.

The ""everyone else is doing it"" excuse to impede traffic is not a defense, anymore than it works for speeding. Not to mention the traffic is being generated by traffic impeders in the first place. So they create the situation, and then want you to be happy suffering from the situation they created? Not going to happen.

Just keep right except to pass, it makes law enforcement's job easier to pick off the speeders.","Oh please. How many times have I seen an impatient driver creep up the butt of the car in the left lane when traffic in ALL lanes is moving at EXACTLY the same speed because, jeez, there are a lot of cars on the road. What advantage do they think theyre going to get?","
Just out of curiosity, how many accidents have you witnessed in real time on this route. I think a fair question, as I can probably count the amount of accidents I've seen on one or two hands in real-time.

Or are you just projecting your biases with a conclusion of fault based on only seeing the wreckage? I usually conclude that someone was on their cell phone or other distraction because I don't understand how you rear-end a car going the same direction as everyone on the freeway. I suppose you could be cut-off in a manner by an unsafe lane change that makes a rear-end collision inevitable. Good reason to get a dash cam.","
Tell yourself whatever you want. I also like to go fast sometimes, sometimes I go faster than the speed limit. We all do. Oh, my.... I'm not in ""speed kills"" camp at all, but I just grew tired of reading incessant fast-and-safe-no-matter-what-the-facts-I-have-my-own-statistics posts, I just had to say something.",Anybody know what this is?,"
A sports coupe.","
A fair question. Accidents that I have seen happen, on that particular route, during the last 8 years -- probably 5 or 6. To the best of my memory, two were rear enders and the rest were side collisions. Mostly happens when 2 cars try to move into a hole in the traffic, one from the right, one from the left. And during that same 8 years, I have seen literally hundreds of near misses from that scenario.

Now there have been quite a few more where I did not see the crash-bam-boom, but did see the aftermath. And if the damage is primarily to the sides of the cars (not limited to front and rear), I make the assumption it was due to lane changing.

Don't get me wrong, I am not some ""never exceed the speed limit"" type. Give me a nice open highway, no traffic (or very light traffic), dry conditions, excellent visibility, and I am very likely going to exceed the speed limit. Sometimes by 20 or 30 mph or even more.

But not in traffic. The more traffic, the more we all need to go with the flow. I'm sorry if you don't like it. This is much like the other discussion about noisy neighbors. If you don't want to put up with noisy neighbors, move to the country and buy yourself 5 acres. But if you're like most of us, you have to live in the city in order to make a living. And deal with occasionally noisy neighbors, and bad traffic on a regular daily basis.

It is what it is.",A red one.,"
Looks like we will be flying to Florida and back....my wife doesn't like driving that far. But, Stinking Creek Road? How would you like to tell people you live on Stinking Creek Road?","
That makes sense. I haven't seen side swipes but I have seen near-misses a lot. This is exactly why I rail against left lane camping. These simultaneous lane changes happen directly because someone is forcing passes on the right, while the slowest traffic is being passed on the left. This is exactly where those greater speed differentials come into play. Middle lane campers force passes on both sides of them in 4+ lane highways. If all passes were on the left, traffic just becomes so much more predictable and safe. Lane changes for the most part, cease to be a hazardous event.

I'm not the fastest car out there. I like to stay around the 85th percentile. OK, maybe 90%. So that still means there are faster cars than me out there regularly, and the last thing I want is to be surprised by them because of a Prius in the left lane. Forcing passes to the right goes against nature! I'm not bothered by someone going faster than me. It really is no skin off my back!

I just don't see anything positive resulting from traffic being slowed down and forced right. You'll always have people assuming ""you're all just a bunch of IDIOTS!"" for going so slow. I maintain the best way to avoid high congestion is to allow free flowing traffic.

I'm going to let out a speeder's secret.... after weaving carefully and safely in and around a dozen or more cars, you are often rewarded with a good stretch of open highway, 1/2 mile, 3/4/ of a mile, maybe even multiple miles. This happens even in LA of all places. Traffic often moves in pockets, even in very high congestion. I look at these pockets as solar system or galaxy clusters. There's a lot of space in between.","I'll guess a kit or homebuilt custom - very non-exotic door handles.

The result does not surprise me. It's not about driving ""too fast"". It's about driving like a moron - cutting people off, distracted, not paying attention, lane encroachment, etc. Either through recklessness (I'm more important than you), or lack of focus (I can't be bothered, I have to look at this text message), or lack of skill (what's does this lever do?). Combine that with high speed, over or under the limit and you get death of the innocent as often as the guilty. Speed limits are aimed to reduce catastrophic nature of accidents that occur from those other primary reasons. Driving too slow is a real problem, but number of such people is (by my completely unscientific observation) much smaller than driving too fast (or whatever you call it). If we ALL drove slower, accidents would have been less deadly (even if they might be more frequent in some circumstances). I'm not advocating for that all, as there is a practical limit and proper risk-to-reward aspect of allowing higher speeds, but it's a fact.","

I’ve been reading the last several pages of posts regarding speed of vehicles on interstates or highways.  I’m having a problem wrapping my head around the rationale(s) proffered for driving significantly over the speed limit.

I drive a 10 mile round trip segment of the Florida Turnpike just about every morning and I fail to understand why drivers are going 75-80 mph in moderate traffic, zig-zagging in and out of the 3 traffic lanes.  The speed limit is 65 mph, but I can agree that 70 mph is an acceptable stretch of that 65 mph limit.  

I drive a car that would have no difficulty running at 90 mph safely on any well-paved multi-lane Highway, but why would I want to do 90, or 80 or even 75 in a 65 zone?  Unless all the traffic is moving at high speed as on the German Autobon, it is irresponsible to jeopardize the lives of drivers observing the speed limit or 5 mph over the speed limit.  

To take the psition that a driver can travel 15-20 mph over a posted speed limit because he or she “can” is dangerous and very suspect!  I see it every day on the Turnpike.  When I drive up to see my brother near Jacksonville, I drive at a steady 75 mph on roads that have a posted 70 mph limit.  Why is it necessary to drive at 80 or 85 mph?  It places all drivers on the road in jeopardy due to inconsiderate speeders.

If I lived in Montana, The Dakota’s or other rural areas of rural States where there is no posted speed limit, I might consider going 80 or 90 mph so long as all the traffic was moving at that speed.  But I refuse to place my life and the lives of others in jeopardy because of speeds significantly above the posted limit.",So they are going to change the dates of the Detroit auto show in 2020 and more manufacturers are pulling out of various annual auto shows.

You are right, stick.  Being 2500 miles from those you love is a terrible situation.  Doctor won’t let me fly since I developed a blood clot in my left knee area 10 years ago.  So, I have to wait for summer to see them.

Mike I just had an idea. Hear me out: How would you like to see your poster buddy and his wife? Since you are willing to lay out $1000 for round trip airfare for your Son and Grandson, spending less than $220 plus baggage fees of $92 for the round trip, you can see us. I just checked and that is the price with Spirit Airlines flying out of Latrobe PA to Fort Lauderdale for the second week in January 2019 till January 28, 2019. I say that is a real bargain especially considering that Mrs. j can cook you up some tasty meals during that period and if you're nice to me I could bring along a bottle of my favorite car wax so that when I have finished doing your car it will be the envy of your complex. Think it over and you'll see that is a great bargain for both of us. jmonroe

You haven't debunked it as much as disagreed with it. Time saved by going faster is a function of speed difference and distance, but that doesn't account for traffic, traffic controls and other obstacles. For example, I will be driving to Florida later this month, a drive just over 1,200 miles. Going 1 MPH faster could save me 12 minutes or more, but on my daily commute an additional 1 MPH shortens my drive time by maybe 10 seconds. And that doesn't account for congestion.

In high congestion areas especially in rush hour traffic going faster mostly gets you to the next light faster, not through it faster.

Since the average driver drives less than 50 miles a day on average and a great deal of it in congested areas little time can be saved.

Now for your 5 minutes a day, saved time must be spent when saved or its wasted. If I save $5 a day for 30 days and I would have an extra $150 at the end of the month. If you save 5 minutes a day for 30 days at the end of the month you will not have any extra time.

I would restate that as ""many accidents are caused by drivers not moving with the normal flow"". Too fast or too slow are equally dangerous.

Yeah, never quite got or understood the ""maniac"" part. I just assume they got somewhere to be. It doesn't offend my ego when someone passes me, which will almost always be on the left if I can help it (sometimes you do go into Lemming mode in the passing lane in very heavy traffic), but 99% of the time I'm yielding to faster traffic. I have hope their front bumper is more intimidating than mine to the guy in front impeding traffic (and hope they'll be a more aggressive tailgater too).

There are go-getters, and there are Lemmings. Go-Getters don't do Lemming well.

By the way, some commutes are pretty long for many people. I have 30 miles to cover, I could easily get a few miles ahead of you, especially if I caught one light you didn't before getting on the freeway. Yes, the chances of an accident in that short span are low, but they are possible. I've encountered bad wrecks where I was early enough on scene that traffic hadn't gone haywire yet, and law enforcement hadn't bottle-necked the situation even worse yet. So while I was only slowed down 2 or 3 minutes at most, the people 3 miles back might be slowed down 10 times more.","

I'd give this slow guy a pass if his target was the next exit. It's safer for him (and rest of us, too) to limp for a few miles and get off at a controlled access point (if he can) than stop altogether at a random location. On the other hand, the ""immortal"", who makes no mistakes, driving and weaving at 20 mph higher, convinced that normal rules of traffic and laws of physics don't apply to him, is the one that is more dangerous, as he/she will do it for miles and miles with no intention to let up.","

Actually, the Solomon curve goes parabolically higher and steeper on the slower side than the faster side (slightly). And in fact, going slightly over the average flow is the bottom of the curve, not zero.

Lastly, weaving is a symptom of a disease. That disease is left lane camping. Eradicating left lane camping makes weaving extinct, among many other undesirable behaviors.

Speed differential hazards are almost wiped out if you have lane discipline and strict adherence to passing laws. The reason speed differentials are so hazardous in the USA is because of our poor adherence to lane laws as a group of people.","

As I understood the backup was long from on top of the mountains. TDOT was diverting traffic onto a detour route. Most likely the heavy southbound end-of-4th-of-July traffic Sunday night had an accident because of an aggressive driver taking chances.

On Friday, if I understand correctly, there was a landslide on top of the mountain in the area of Stinking Creek Road and the next exit south of there. @100 will appreciate knowing he's not being slowed by the diversion of traffic onto the other side giving one lane traffic.
Actually, the main causes of wrecks are summed up by the following:

1) Distraction
2) Drowsiness
3) Drunkenness

Get rid of those 3 things and Utopia is almost achieved. Number 4 is likely left lane camping, which #1 is certainly a partial, but not full cause of left lane camping. I firmly believe the ""oblivious acting"" is just that, an act, by a passive-aggressive hall monitor type."

You are right, stick.  Being 2500 miles from those you love is a terrible situation.  Doctor won’t let me fly since I developed a blood clot in my left knee area 10 years ago.  So, I have to wait for summer to see them.

I've debunked the ""speeding doesn't save time, or at least not significant time"" many times. I've debunked it in my own real-world studies. Occasionally you'll get caught up to at red lights, but occasionally you'll also arrive 15 minutes earlier on a 30 minute drive because the slowpoke got caught by a 20 MPH moving train that's 3 miles long, the train you managed to avoid by mere seconds because you sped for mere seconds. The sucker gets caught by the falling traffic arms by mere seconds. I'm sure if we graphed the time savings it would be a bell curve like anything else. Multiple 5 minutes saved by thousands of commute days in your lifetime, and suddenly you've lived years longer; at least outside of your car. If you call commuting living, well, then you win.
You haven't debunked it as much as disagreed with it. Time saved by going faster is a function of speed difference and distance, but that doesn't account for traffic, traffic controls and other obstacles. For example, I will be driving to Florida later this month, a drive just over 1,200 miles. Going 1 MPH faster could save me 12 minutes or more, but on my daily commute an additional 1 MPH shortens my drive time by maybe 10 seconds. And that doesn't account for congestion.

In high congestion areas especially in rush hour traffic going faster mostly gets you to the next light faster, not through it faster.

Since the average driver drives less than 50 miles a day on average and a great deal of it in congested areas little time can be saved.

Now for your 5 minutes a day, saved time must be spent when saved or its wasted. If I save $5 a day for 30 days and I would have an extra $150 at the end of the month. If you save 5 minutes a day for 30 days at the end of the month you will not have any extra time.",Have bin injoying  reading all in hear  how was everyone’s. 4thh  mine was good hung out with family   For an few days came home  last night

Yep, I lived in Palm Desert for 7 years - but usually the temps in the summer would average 102 to 108 degrees.  116+ was a rare occurrence - but I do remember 120+ once or twice.  

I was visiting my folks folks here in Florida back in 1995.  It was hot and very humid - 95 every day and all I did was sweat when I went outside.  I remember getting on my plane to go home and when I deplaned in Palm Springs, it was 110 - felt like an oven - but dry.  In a way, it was a relief from all that humidity.  In winter, I had a humidifier in my bedroom because I would get nose bleeds due to the dry air - relative humidity would go down to 4 or 5 percent.

I’ve been to Key West several times - once about 5 years ago.  The drive from Florida City (termination point of the Florida Turnpike) to Key West is nice if you are in no hurry to get there.  US Rt 1 is the only way in and out of the Keys.  Driving through the Keys is great if you have the time to stop and explore some of Keys - especially Islamorada and Key Marathon.  Great seafood restaurants on both.

If they like to fish, lay out on the beaches, drink fancy tropical cocktails, eat seafood, explore nightspots, swim with dolphins on Key Largo, and enjoy leisurely sightseeing, then the Keys are delightful except for hurricane season - September and October are the most active hurricane months so I caution vacationers.

I prefer Islamorada Key for a great vacation.  In case of a hurricane, you are close to the Florida mainland and won’t have to worry about the long drive from Key West if you need to evacuate.  It is a much shorter drive from Miami/Ft. Lauderdale.  There are plenty of upscale accommodations that can also arrange boat rentals, scuba diving, dining, sightseeing, etc.  I’ve stayed there a few times and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Dad was working with a construction company and he managed the building of a bridge from Big Pine Key to No Name Key (a deer reserve). Mom had to drive 30 miles each week to Key West to shop at the largest grocery store at the time, Safeway if I remember correctly. Dad rented a house on Big Pine, which was decent, but no ac, or washer dryer. At the time, there were shacks, similar to a lean to, up and down A1. Inside those were coin operated washers and dryers. The first time we went in one, mom came racing out. A land crab came out from under one of the machines and ran over her foot! From there on, mom took a broom, banged it on the floor and waited for any critters to run out before she went in. Simple times. My wife and I visited the Keys in 2000. We enjoyed ourselves, but wow how it had changed! I'm sure it has even changed more since.","

While he does not get a huge discount by being a dealer for any brand, the difference between what he pays for and A/C unit if he was a dealer and if he isn’t is about 7% (quick math, that’s about $250 on the typical install). He said he’ll eat that amount by not having to pay commissions to a sales person and to make higher margins on service work and installs without tying up capital in whole units.

Me (one who is divorced, BTW)? I feel if you’re the bread winner and the only one driving the car (I thought I remembered you mentioning your wife doesn’t drive), you choose when and what to buy. Simple as that. Drawing down on a pension before you retire isn’t something I’d want to do. Not sure what the advantage is by doing that.

Bottom line, I think until you make your own decision about what to buy, and how to buy it, when you buy it, you’re sorta spinning your wheels but going nowhere.

Good luck!!!!!

graphicguy - I can't find anything wrong with your analysis of my ""paralysis by analysis"" description of what's going on with me and cars. Pretty much spot on - and, it's her reaction to what I try and do that I'm trying to ""think out"". But I agree with you, and I could see many people agreeing with us, the breadwinner and sole driver (yes GG she doesn't drive) is the one who determines what ta buy and when ta buy it, too.

Her idea was ta start getting my Boeing pension benefits at age 60 instead of age 62 or 65 - so her idea is to start collecting them monthly at age 60 and save most of that money up and just buy a 2017 Nissan Sentra S 6-speed stick or a cherry Ford Focus ST (OK I added the car examples completely - she isn't even aware of the ones I want and like, she doesn't really care) in cash. This would be with either 2 or 5 years left ta work my Allied Healthcare job before I retire. It's lookin' like 65 is the age I'm gonna have ta go to so our medical insurance continues to be covered. Otherwise, I'd retire at age 62.

I think you have a pretty good grip on my situation, graphicguy, and what's running through my mind.

https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/05/the-highway-lane-next-to-yours-isnt-really-moving-any-faster/394079/

They miss the fundamental truth of humans and driving. 99% of us want to simply drive unimpeded at our preferred speed.

A slow poke will be just as annoyed by a SLOWER POKE in the passing lane as a speed demon gets annoyed at a mild speeder that stubbornly impedes the passing lane. They will both pass on the right if forced to do so. They behave exactly the same when impeded.

Congestion and traffic causes everyone to drive below their preferred speed; so of course they try to get ahead of the pack to find that illusive open highway of unimpeded progress!!!!

I think it is a small percentage of the population that actually feels as though their manhood shrinks 1 millimeter every time they are passed on the highway, while growing their manhood 1 MM every time they pass someone. I don't feel that way. I know some left lane campers might, but it has to be a rather small percentage. The fundamental factor is what I state above.","I've already done my own studies on the psychology of the left lane dominators and left lane pokers. Over years.

Ohio has gone to adjustable speed limits because they found that when limits are reduced in congested areas, the number of cars flowing through increases. The study talks about the percentage of cars that within 10 mph of each other in speed and other things. If I see it again, I'll link it. Try looking for Ohio adjustable speed limits.

But that agrees with my observations. The higher the frictional speed difference between those in the right lane, usually trucks at 60-63, and those in the left whether second or third lane, the more problems occur causing a lowering in the number of cars using the left most lane because of the aggressive behavior of a part of the speeders who are there. Add to that the movement in and out of cars into one lane to the right to make room for the speeders who are tailgating, and that reduces the overall flow of vehicles.","Reading ""ta"" in places where ""to"" should be is getting in the way of reading certain posts.

AT first I thought you were talking about the Canadians celebrating July 1 and that they were early...","had to do an unexpected assembly job today. Our old gas grill crapped out (it was an inexpensive Driver rationalization special), with burners rotting out, so went to the store to get a new one. All set up ready to go, so paid and wheeled it out to the car. Wrestled it into the back of the RDX, and discovered it was about 2"" too wide to really fit. So decided to take on in the box instead of trying to half take it apart out in the parking lot to get it to fit. after an hour+ interpreting the hieroglyphic instructions with parts strewn all over the kitchen floor, got is assembled and working. Vastly better performance at least. And nothing blew up!

If you live in a warmer climate for a few years (Houston, where I am, for example), you find yourself hoping for at least one hard freeze over the winter. If you don't get at least one (and that definitely happens, no hard freeze), then the bugs the next spring and summer are MUCH worse.

+1 to that. If you're old enough to remember what cars used to be like that, truly there are no bad cars these days. I have considered buying a classic muscle car. I owned a 67 Barracuda Formula S, a 69 Charger R/T 440, a 1970 Challenger convertible, a 1972 Dodge Demon 340, and a 1976 Firebird Trans Am.

But my present Ford F150 is faster than most of those I listed (exception for the 69 Charger and the 72 Demon). And a whole lot less trouble. While I don't mind doing my own oil changes and tune ups, I do not want to be stranded by the side of the road when the electrical gremlins strike, or it decides to throw off all of the belts, or (choose any other minor catastrophe)

Way back in the day, my brother owned a Geo Metro. I rather liked that little sucker with the 3 cylinder engine. Exception for the ungodly steering. If you owned one of those, you didn't need to belong to a gym, you got a full upper body workout every time you drove it. But the front seats were really spacious, a lot of free space, room to sit up straight, extend your arms, etc.

While shopping for the new F150 I was sitting in a Ford showroom at a salesman's desk, and a new Ecosport was sitting next to me, so I checked it out. Along with a new Shelby Mustang, and a decked out F250 (who knew those suckers ran up to $70k these days?) Anyway, back to the Ecosport. I rather liked it, reminded me a little bit of a modernized Geo Metro. 3 cylinder engine even (but turbocharged, this is the 21st century). And it had a surprising amount of front seat room. Not as much as the old Geo Metro, but more than most new cars.

I could see myself owning one of those for a commute car.","iluv driver100 - a 2013 Ford Focus ST isn't anywhere near done. Like shifty sez, new and newer cars ought ta go 175,000 miles these days. That's 114,000 more miles. For a grand automotive purchase price of less than $15,000? For a car that goes 0-60 in only 6.2 seconds? What's not ta love and cherish about this deal?


That 175000 was an average. We heard one car went 600000 miles, so when you average 600000 and what the Ford Focus got...it was a very low number to average 175000!

Besides, it is the end of the week and you will have a new wish list next week. Looking is more fun than buying, especially when you make your car payment each month.

btw....if you can manage the new payments why not double your monthly payment and pay your Soul off in one year?

Not being critical....just something to think about.........","No need ta double up on payments to pay off the Soul quicker. That's the beauty of this. I'd only be financing $15,000, which includes the finance charges. At least mostly. It might end up being $15,500 for 5 years.","I try to be more disciplined....not saying I am right. Just works for me.
I think if you want something, you don't absolutely need, and you have to stretch your budget a bit, you should do something to demonstrate you will do something extra to get it.
If you want a new car....and you are under water on your current car....then manipulating the loan time can be a solution....but, not a great one......and $15000, to get a car with 5 years of miles on it....doesn't seem to be the best solution.....but, that is just me.

If for some reason, the car isn't as good as you think it is...you will be way under water.","Driver, good advice. If you finance 60 months I would try to buy something no older than 3 yrs. Even then, in retrospect, I don't think we will do that again. The Pilot was 3 yrs old in '13 when we bought it. It was Honda certified and had just turned 50k, fully serviced, new battery, wiper blades, alignment, brakes front and back and it cost about 60% of a new one. Yet, as we get ready to make the last few payments I have an 8 year old car. In addition we've had to do the expensive maintenance, spark plugs, battery, timing belt, front brakes/rotors to keep it in tip top shape. The intent is to keep it as my wife is insistent on no new payments but if it starts acting up she will be the first to give it the boot. It has 119k on it now.","We are enjoying our stay in Jacksonville. It is significantly cooler here than home, where it was 98 on Monday.
The fireworks display last night was impressive and we had a great view from the 14th floor of my SIL apt. The barge that shot off the fireworks was parked directly in front of us. Our dogs were not impressed, however. We leave tomorrow to go home to an non-airconditioned house. Ugh. Fingers crossed the system will be replaced on Saturday.","
Exactly. If it is your primary vehicle and racking up miles, financing an older car can be problematic from a financial standpoint. ","I have used a 5 year and warranty period rule. That is, no payments on a car more than 5 YO, or out of warranty.

Somewhat arbitrary, but it forces you to buy within your means for the most part. And hard to be much under water.","I have used a 5 year and warranty period rule. That is, no payments on a car more than 5 YO, or out of warranty.

Somewhat arbitrary, but it forces you to buy within your means for the most part. And hard to be much under water.","
It is a tough call. Your Pilot was fully serviced with a clean bill of health and you had the piece of mind of the CPO warranty. You've put a lot into it as far as maintenance goes and it should last you as long as you are willing to keep it. Even at 8 years old, your 120K Pilot is still worth something if you wanted to part ways with it. You also saved 40% off the price of a new one up front, so you have to figure that into your ownership cost as well.

Since I do have to finance my cars, one of the reasons that I bought my CPO Infiniti last year was the fact that it was MUCH cheaper than it was brand new in late 2014, it had less than 7,500 miles on the odometer, and they had 0.99% financing for 3 years. It will actually be paid off before my Legacy (had I kept it the full term).

I maintain my cars ""by the book"" as many of you do. There are so many people that just don't bother or care. They will lease a $50K BMW, MB, or Audi and take it to Jiffy Lube for a ""$39.99 Special"" when the car calls for it, then not change the brake fluid, coolant, differential fluid (on AWD cars here in the NE). If you have a dealer that just ""slaps"" the CPO warranty on the car, details it so it looks pretty, & you have a problem on your hand.

Someone I do business with bought a beautiful CPO 2015 X5 (Dark Blue/Black Leather/M Sport/Pano Roof/Heads Up Display) about a year ago. He was looking for a very specific X5 as far as color/options go which as we know isn't always the easiest thing to do when you are buying used/CPO. After about a week of driving the car, he began to notice it smelled like stale smoke and got musty smelling when he was driving without the AC compressor running. There was also a cracked side marker light and cracked brake light lens the he didn't notice when he took delivery. He brought the car back to the dealer who removed the cabin filter which was BLACK (a clear indication the car was smoked in heavily) as well as the slightly damaged lenses I mentioned above. There was so much residual smoke in the carpeting and in the upholstery that it took a second cabin filter change plus a FULL interior detail for the smoke smell to finally dissipate.",Hard to believe he didn’t notice the smoke smell before he bought the car. It’s so strong you can never get it out.,"Regular and thorough maintenance is something I've always done, often more frequently than really needed. I also try to keep the vehicle clean, waxed and nicely presentable. The Pilot still looks nice, drives well and should provide us many more miles of pleasure, assuming the unexpected doesn't happen. My wife still likes it a lot, is very comfortable with how it drives and fits her needs, so that is a definite plus. If I tried to trade it without 'good reason' I will be sleeping in the garage or worse!","
It was ""surfaced cleaned"" and odor neutralized to be presentable so well that he didn't notice it.","
I have no doubt that if I didn't receive the strong trade offer I was expecting, that I'd still be driving our 2011 Pilot. Although I DO like driving the new 2017 that is 6+ months old and has 9K miles. I don't like making payments, but we are so very happy with the new one! The 2011 would have 111K on it had we kept it.","
The level of CPO preparation is only as good as the dealer that is performing it. That cabin filter should have changed.","
I agree with you 100%.","
Not true. There are ways. Commercial outfits use ozone generators. Hotels and motels use them, and you can probably find a good detail shop in your area that has one. The smell will tend to return after an ozone treatment, but at lower levels, eventually fading away.

When I bought my 2016 Town and Country, I knew from the carfax that it had been a rental unit. There was no odor when I drove it, and when I first brought it home. A few days later, I started to pick up ""that smell"". I did a full cleaning of every leather, vinyl and plastic surface, and used Arm and Hammer Carpet Odor Eliminator (basically baking soda with some smell good added). You spread that on all the carpets, let it sit for a few hours, and then vacuum up as much as you can. This will leave a residual odor that is not exactly what you want, but better than cigarette smell. Add to that a couple of the ""smell good"" sticks in the A/C vents, and you can mask the unpleasant odors. By the time the perfume faded away in a couple of months, the cigarette odor was gone as well. I have had the minivan for about 18 months now, and for the last 15 or 16 months it has been basically odor free.","Sda&Nyc....there is a time to hold them and there is a time to fold them. Nothing wrong with a CPO or well maintained pre-owned car, but there is a sweet spot of time when it is best to get out.

I think that ""If you finance 60 months I would try to buy something no older than 3 yrs"" makes a lot of sense. A rule I followed was..............I would try to make a down payment large enough so that the car was worth more than what I owed on it, just in case I went under. When I leased a car (92 Cavalier) I had almost enough from my trade in to cover the lease payments for 3 years if I had to.

But, owing $15000 on a car that sells for $11500 that is 5 years old....that could be a huge pit to climb out of if something goes wrong.","@iluvmysephia1 .....I never had much luck with Carmax. They always lowballed me (by a lot) on trades and wanted high retail on anything I was interested in. So, I quit shopping them.

From where I sit, it seems you are in “paralysis by analysis” mode on what you want, how you want to buy it and how to sell it to your wife.

Me (one who is divorced, BTW)? I feel if you’re the bread winner and the only one driving the car (I thought I remembered you mentioning your wife doesn’t drive), you choose when and what to buy. Simple as that. Drawing down on a pension before you retire isn’t something I’d want to do. Not sure what the advantage is by doing that.

Bottom line, I think until you make your own decision about what to buy, and how to buy it, when you buy it, you’re sorta spinning your wheels but going nowhere.

Good luck!!!!!",To our wonderful hosts....any idea when the “log in problems” are going to be resolved?,"Probably when they convert to the new process, combining forums access with insider access","We are leaving to go to London UK in a few hours.

Pretty old car at this point. Will just have to see if it happens again. Could be one of a hundred possibilities, some of which may never happen again (water in fuel, for example). At this age, however, hopefully much maintenance has been done such as full tuneup including fuel filter, plugs, etc.

Question: What heat related condition could cause a car to stall on a hot day? I thought vapor lock went away with the introduction of fuel injection. Happened to son's car. Started right back up and gave no further problem. Temps were in the 90s.
What car and what was he doing when the car stalled?
2005 Sable with the Duratech V6. About 75k miles. He had just dropped off a rider and turned around in her driveway. As he started moving forward he said it just stalled. Started right up and dove for hours problem free for the rest of the day. Temp gauge read normal.

I am not mechanically inclined but I think it happened because it is a Ford.

I had a Fusion rental almost 2 years ago and it cut out on me and died on a hill. Had to restart it once, and it chugged with half power, then I restarted again came back. Enterprise said it had happened before and it would be going back to Ford......so, I think it is normal.","

Out to Philly last night in the Miata. Supposedly no rain in the forecast. Getting close to the city the rain starts up. Got the top up nice and quickly (thank goodness for the shoulder) and spent 45 minutes or so sounding like I was driving a tent. Made the mistake of Google Maps. Took me to the Mann Center executive offices in Center City. The actual Center is miles away. Fortunately, I planned to be there plenty early and was still early. Emmylou Harris and Ry Cooder.

tjc78 - are you a big Ford proponent? If so, or even if you aren't, what'd'ya think of Ford totally dumping production of passenger cars earlier this year? I don't like it. I'm looking at possibly making a deal on one of these:


2013 Ford Focus ST 5-door hatchback turbo 6-speed

I left Ford in May of 1999 for Kia Motors, I bought a 1999 Kia Sephia 5-speed sedan at that time for $7,995. No A/C, no stereo radio, no radio of any kind. I took to the Kia brand pretty quickly, the small Sephia needed some Yokohama tires and Konig Diva wheels on it after tax refund time in Feb. of 2001. Ran like a little champ then and I grew more and more enamored to the Kia brand as time went on.

58% of the cars I've bought have been Fords, however, and I don't have a valid reason to believe this little golden rocket from Ford will be a Fix-Or-Repair-Daily. I have faith that Ford did it right. Now, my first car was a '65 Ford Mustang. Oxidized paint but cool inside slotted dish wheels and a 200 c.i. 6 cyl. engine with a stick shift transmission. Must've been a 4-speed stick but for some reason I keep thinking it was a 3-speed, I don't know why. I'm getting it mixed up with Dad's '66 VW Fastback 4-speed stick or his '63 GMC Jimmy pickup. That truck may have been the only 3-speed outta the bunch and the rest were 4-speeds.

My point is is the '65 Stang 6cyl. 4-speed stick was always at least blowing a light bulb if it wasn't brakes going out, clutch burning out, or engine trouble of some sort or transmission problems. The transmission was pretty consistent - it was the other parts of the small American car that didn't hold up. I always found a way ta get it back on the road - it was my only transportation that was my own. I could always borrow one of Dad's rigs in a pinch, though.

But are you a big Ford proponent, tjc78? I wasn't planning on returning to Ford for a new car purchase, but this little gold rocket has me ensnared in the possibilities of driving it. If somebody else picks it up it'll take the problem out of my hands. Ford man you are?","@driver100,
Too bad Enterprise didn't treat you better, considering where they based.
Were you wearing that shirt when you picked up the car?","
My Fusion rental car definitely stalled on a hill in the middle of the road.
I should have put in a , didn't expect to be taken seriously.
It was a Ford but realistically, it could happen to any car. The Chrysler 300 they replaced it with had steering that wanted to do it's own thing","btw....just to clarify. I don't think there are any pos cars. There are a few cars I would not consider myself.....a Fiat and a Smartcar being the only two I can think of (and that Mazda 2 tiny bug).......and that is mainly because they seem so unsafe to me.

I think Ford makes pretty good cars....in fact most cars are pretty good these days....just some suit me better than others......because of the way they are designed, or because of the way they handle....or I like the looks. I would consider a Fusion or a Mustang if I was interested in that class of car, or a Ford truck if that is what I was looking for.

When we bought the 2013 Passat it was my wife's car really, I probably would have chosen a nicely equipped Fusion that was about $20000. I got nothing against Ford, GM or Chrysler.....I choose what I do because it suits me, not because I don't like any brand.","
That sounded like a lot of back peddling to me.

jmonroe","I never understood all the hand-wringing about the size of the Fiat 500. We rented one for fun to visit our son when he was a student at South Carolina. We loved it; if we didn't already have the Clubman to use as my work beater I'd pick up a used Abarth in a heartbeat. Of course I've corrupted my wife to the point that she doesn't like large cars either. The 2er is the largest car in our garage by nearly a foot; everything else is 165"" long or less.","I think Ford dropping sedans is a smart move..... if a product doesn’t sell or isn’t profitable why carry it?

Oh, well I'm just trying to decide if I want to seriously pursue the 2013 Ford Focus ST 6-speed turbo or take the easy way out. My wife gets so fiery about new (or new ta us) car purchases that I have to brace myself for impact. I figure if one of you were to come out and talk down the little golden rocket I would reconsider my efforts and just take the easy way out and just pay off the final two years of 2011 Kia Soul 5-speed payments and drive and maintain the car. Then trade it in for another rig - I do change my favorites so often that who knows what it might be in July of 2020!

Any of you know anything about Car Max? They will buy your car from you, whether you trade yours for one off of their lot or not? Because I owe $5,721.65 on the Soul. 2 more years of payments. I wonder what Car Max would buy my car from me for? $3,750? It's got 100,239 miles on it and it's running fine. It occasionally hard starts but I just need ta go get plugs and plug wires installed, or, it might need a fuel pump or just a fuel filter replaced.

I have noticed the 2013 Ford Focus ST 6-speed turbo's are all priced higher on Car Gurus than this guy's is priced here in Alamogordo. He only wants $11,500 for a car with 61,000 miles. They are asking $13,500-$14,000-$15,000 for these cars on nationwide CarGurus, and, what's more, most of those cars have more than 61,000 miles. He puts a trade-in sheet from NADA guides on the windshield that basically tells potential buyers that he's selling the car for about $4,500 too little. But I have verified that he's telling the truth - these cars are selling for $15,000 for this model and year - with more than 61,000 miles on them!

He says it's in excellent condition, and now that I don't think he's a liar I am even more interested. Oh, the Recaro seats are leather and it also has a power sunroof. I don't need a power sunroof but our '08 Lancer GTS had one and it was really cool to open it up on summer desert nights and hear the wind run through it. So that would be cool ta get that in the deal, too.

So I would give it that test that roadburner was talking about - what is it called, a PSI? And have the car thoroughly checked out. I'm getting those strong iluvmysephia1 feelings about this pup. The same ones that backfired on me in May 2016 when I drove west to Denver to trade for an Abyss 2016 Scion iA 6-speed! I knew the only way ta get that baby was ta take off on my own and just go buy it. Wasn't meant ta be, though. The first salesman I could get the attention of told me they sold the Abyss (black) iA not one half hour before I walked in the door. Now, Denver is a big rat-race like the city I grew up in, Seattle. Absolutely anyone can jump in and buy the car out from under you on your way to the dealer. Unless you go through their internet department ahead of time and do the deal on your e-mail or the like of that. I came home to my 22"" HP monitor's screen scratched up because she got her lipstick out and tettered it all up. And I of course cleaned it all up - and it left some scratches on the screen. What the?

So the Mrs. is serious about not blowing money on cars. If I cause a wild hair to grow and decide I want a car really bad, I had best either rob a bank on the way so I can pay for it in cash, or think twice about heading in to buy it. She's been talking about drawing my Boeing pension earlier than age 62, saving up for a year or so, and buying a iluvmeysephia1-type car with cash completely.

If I did this deal, I'd still have the Soul to pay off. I'm used to just taking the dealer trade-in hit. Can't do that this time - there's no dealer sheet on the windshield of the Focus ST. Just his NADA research sheet that backs up the great deal he's asking and his own typed-up sheet where he lists details about the car, the price and his phone number. So I could call him discreetly and ask for a test drive and go from there. If Car Max gave me a good enough offer and then I financed the '13 Ford Focus RT at our bank or a local credit union before rates go up, then I would be in like flint. And wearing a football helmet to protect my head. Not from crashes in the Focus ST, from my wife! I love to drive - she does not drive. Financially, this purchase would not hurt us whatsoever. I'm working another 3-6 years, still. Probably 6 more years, the payment on this would depend on what I could sell my Kia Soul (not my own Soul!!) for. But I would say it's gonna be around $275 a month, or less, not more. For 5 years - perhaps $500 down would be all I'd put down on it. If it checked out I'd be interested in doing it - unless the test drive sucked, of course. I just re-did the math. If someplace gave me $3,750 for my '11 Kia Soul and took it off my hands, I'd owe them $1,971.65. Thrown that in on a loan from the credit union for $11,500, and ya got a grand total of $13,471.65 to finance. Subtract $500 down and you got only $12,971.65 to finance. $500 down and 60 months ta pay = a payment of only $216.19 a month. Wow - it would all hinge on a company buying my car from me. Or I could try and market and sell the Kia Soul on my own. I'd like to wrap it all in to one or one and a half deals wrapped into one loan from the credit union, or Wells Fargo. I left the interest rate off of the purchase price and the monthly payment, but it shouldn't affect the deal much at all. Wow - thanks for being a good online sounding board - this one's gonna stick in my brain even worse now.

I'm not getting any younger but I really, really love ta drive. This car would be a blast like I still feel the 2016 Scion iA would be. BTW - I could get a CPO 2016 Scion iA 6-speed for $12,999. So close to the Focus RT in price. This NADA guide totals everything up the car has and lists a going price according to NADA of $16,050 for the '13 Focus RT. The thing is, they're spot on. The price matches pretty much CarGurus' pricing for the car. And he's only asking $11,500. I think that's a pretty fair price.

Any other places buy your rig from you besides Car Max? And is there a catch to Car Max? I have heard their name, of course, but know pretty much nothing about them. When buying new TrueCar sure gives a person a good deal. Any other places buy your car from you? For a fairly fair price?

driver100 - a 2013 Ford Focus ST isn't anywhere near done. Like shifty sez, new and newer cars ought ta go 175,000 miles these days. That's 114,000 more miles.

Hey, driver100, you really think the little Mazda2 hatchback is ugly? Really? I tend to like it - I like it a lot. You're used to large German cars, they're in a different class altogether.

Here's a front view of the 2013 Ford Focus RT - sort of looks Matchbox cars-ish, huh, with those yellow and black bumblebee Recaro seats?


2013 Ford Focus RT in that gold

I do not just like but love that gold on this Focus RT. I saw the baby sitting over on 10th St. again today - they have buffed it very clean, though I noticed the front end has some residual bug guts that I would clean off with glee right after purchase time. It's pretty clean on the body - no dents, scratches or scuffs - I checked it out several days ago pretty thoroughly. I have a feeling that that car is not getting much attention from Alamogordo buyers at all. Cool. This is pickup truck country pretty much. There is a Ford dealer in town, Toyota dealer and a GM dealer.


Oh yeah.","
There was a time when cold weather didn't bother me but the last few years has just about done it for me and I'm thinking about caving and becoming a snowbird. Good to know I won't have to fight with a poster buddy for place to keep me warm come Winter.

A furr-e-ner! Iluv, you putting illegals into your pictures now?

Yes, I think that Mazda 2 is ugly, but I think that 2008 Mitzu has a beautifully proportioned design. I like minimal small cars....and homes for that matter....nothing wrong with small....it is the design.....the Mazda 2 looks like a little bug. Mazda 3 has a pleasant design. Actual design is very important to me.....I think a car should look like a car. Look what they can do with the Focus or the Sentra for that matter......much better looking.

I also said it because one guy at tennis says....when someone shows up with a new car....But, why did you buy such an ugly looking car?","
Paid $130k....will sell for $200k, special offer to you only, $250K.

Ah, not selling for any price unless I have to pay a tariff to get in each time.","
While I have no opinion on the drones, I do have an unpopular opinion on fireworks: I don't like them.

I think it all stems from when I was a little kid and my parents dragged me to a fireworks show. It was really, really loud, I remember it made me scared, and I think that scarred me for life.

The city here seems to have a fireworks fetish because they are always shooting the damn things off and spooking the animals to no end. Plus now there are no restrictions on purchasing them so every drunk/stoned yahoo seems to think they can shoot them off in their yard. Sometimes they go over other people's houses and land on private property while still burning, a nice touch.

Bring on the drones, I say.","oldfarmer50 said:

Pretty old car at this point. Will just have to see if it happens again. Could be one of a hundred possibilities, some of which may never happen again (water in fuel, for example). At this age, however, hopefully much maintenance has been done such as full tuneup including fuel filter, plugs, etc.","

If we ever sell the farm we are headed to Seabrook Island SC.","We went to Seabrook last week for a vacation; maybe Ford is right to drop all but a couple of their cars. Based on my observation, about 60% of the trucks and SUVs were domestic. Cars? Maybe 10% domestic. They were either newer Cadillacs, newer ponycars, or old hoopties. Of the import cars, I'd say 60%-70% were Asian and the remainder were European.
There were more geezers than I remember; notable examples of septuagenarian and up driving prowess included a lady in an Enclave who backed out of a parking space at .0005 mph, stopping every 2 feet for 5 seconds or more to assess her situation, and another lady needing over four attempts to parallel park her X1 in a space large enough to fit an F350.",Happy 4th everyone.

I hit a deer once. Thankfully in my Nissan PU, not our Mazda 323. So I pushed him away, instead of flipping up the hood and through the windshield.

Would be nice to get one of those when it goes in next month for an oil change and state inspection assuming it's part of the selection by then. I'm surprised they would consider putting one in the fleet this early since supplies are probably still tight but I guess it's a good way to showcase it and build excitement for someone that has theirs in the shop.","Last loaner I had was a top level MDX. better than the other time when I got a base ILX.

Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Nothing looks better or shinier than a black car shined up to the max. The problem is, of course, trying to keep it that way. And this is leaving out the problems associated with owning a black car down here in the equatorial belt.

On my new truck, I had a choice between the White Gold, Ingot Silver, and Shadow Black. The black was beautiful, beyond a doubt. Maybe if I lived up in CT where the heat isn't so brutal, and could afford to pay someone to wash and wax twice a week...","

Michaell - sir, you have also earned your Edmund's pay today. Nice find! Perfect for a small car lover like myself. I'm going in there on my desktop after I type this post out and bookmarking it. Interesting that it's in Puerto Rico. I have been slowly asking around and gathering data about retiring in other countries the past month or two.

Who knows - maybe the Mrs. and I will sell this house and retire in Puerto Rico? Or Belize? Or Thailand? I'm researching it now - I work with a native Belizian and he tells me U.S. cash goes a lot further there in Belize. He's a doctor there and a Respiratory Therapist/Sleep Technologist here in America. Some even go to Mexico to retire but I can't seem ta wrap myself around that one.

If the 2011 Kia Soul motors along in to the 100,000 miles as it is (100,129 right now) and doesn't necessitate a change, I may not move to something else at all. I plan on working 6 more years at most, even better would be 3 more years. It's that nasty Healthcare that will possibly keep me working until 65 years of age. But we'll see - thanks for the link.

Interestingly, in 2014 as we were getting ready to leave southern New Mexico for Washington state, a person nearby our rental house in Alamogordo was selling a 2014 Mazda2 hatch for, IIRC, $14,000. It was bright red and the body was clean. I don't think these Maz2 hatches at $17,995 are unreasonably priced at all. Makes sense that Mazda includes Puerto Rico in their list of countries that they'll sell 2 hb's in, too.","
But how did that direct impact workout for the deer?","
I agree 100%. I would never, ever buy property in Mexico - rent only. Laws are not to the same standard we are accustomed too. Some people go bungy jumping or zip-lining in weird countries, if I was to do something like that....and it is almost impossible that I would, it would only be where I could sue their rear ends off if I had to.","


Most foreign buyers buy using cash. It is very difficult to get a loan or mortgage if you are not a citizen...they don't want to try to chase somebody out of the country. Same for a car lease.","

A lot of trouble for an ugly car. Buy it in Puerto Rico and ship it to the mainland for $845. Might work if there is no sales tax there. What if you need a part? I think Iluv was better off with a $12000 Sentra.","nyccarguy said:
