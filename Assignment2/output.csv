Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).

My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."

July 27,Mr_Shiftright,"Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers?  If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be  your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
July 27,Michaell,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."
July 27,henryn,"Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store.  It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer.  It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing,  not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those.  Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).

We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so.

July 17,benjaminh,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."

Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).

So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."

And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."

If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
March 2016,Michaell,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."

March 2016,flightnurse,"so the car is $199/month, and the mop and glow stuff is another $175?"
March 2016,parachautopart,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out.  It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable.  Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person.  Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four""."
April 2016,flightnurse,The lease rate is the factor that stops me cold from taking the leap.
April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW."
April 2016,stickguy,Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?
April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car."
April 2016,flightnurse,"Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers?  If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be  your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
April 2016,flightnurse,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."
April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store.  It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer.  It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing,  not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those.  Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).  To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."
April 2016,kyfdx,"I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf. Just wanted to say I'm still alive, but my 17 year history with Edmunds has seemingly been erased. Also I've been very busy with work. But I wanted to briefly say that I'm still really enjoying the driving experience with my leased 2018 Acura TLX 2.4 Tech. Great car for the money imho. All best wishes out there to the chronic car buyers, etc."
April 2016,Mr_Shiftright,Still on the list.  Just have not been looking actively right now.

April 2016,tlong,If I do manage to upgrade to a TLX it would have to be with a 10 year horizon.
April 2016,andres3,Thanks. I'll give it a try at some point to merge my accounts.
April 2016,tlong,"I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty."
April 2016,andres3,They usually go up as the year goes along. Christmas ind Presidents’ Day are good options.
April 2016,kyfdx,"Yeah, I was and am a bit concerned with getting two new cars at once. But so far we haven't regretted it. The CR-V is also an awesome vehicle.

December 2015,tlong,
December 2015,stickguy,So what is up with Edmunds these days? logging is a pain..

December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,Thinking about it....
December 2015,flightnurse,"Stinger interests me, but not the horrible lease rates."
December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
December 2015,flightnurse,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
December 2015,flightnurse,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
December 2015,flightnurse,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
December 2015,roadburner,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."
December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.
December 2015,andres3,"May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?"
December 2015,flightnurse,Funny...I just had this image of feeding vinyl records into the dashboard.
December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Oh, you mean like this?"
December 2015,graphicguy,Yeah but the BIG ones.
December 2015,roadburner,You asked for it …

December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I believe my XF has a 10gb hard drive, it allows me to upload 10 CDs.  So 10 on the HD, one in the player = the Spinal Tap nirvana of 11."
December 2015,markcincinnati,Another little feature I like on the TLX is the built-in compass....
December 2015,roadburner,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!
December 2015,sweendogy,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."
December 2015,nyccarguy,"Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem."
December 2015,roadburner,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
December 2015,markcincinnati,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."

October 2015,flightnurse,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
October 2015,roadburner,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
October 2015,markcincinnati,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
October 2015,roadburner,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
October 2015,cdnpinhead,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
October 2015,andres3,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

October 2015,roadburner,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!
October 2015,markcincinnati,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
October 2015,markcincinnati,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

September 2015,flightnurse,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

September 2015,dino001,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
September 2015,flightnurse,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
September 2015,robr2,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
September 2015,dino001,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
September 2015,flightnurse,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

September 2015,benjaminh,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

August 2015,roadburner,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

August 2015,qbrozen,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
August 2015,circlew,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
August 2015,dino001,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
August 2015,graphicguy,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
August 2015,jeffm5,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
August 2015,dino001,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."
August 2015,qbrozen,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.

August 2015,circlew,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

August 2015,graphicguy,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

August 2015,dino001,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....

August 2015,dino001,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

June 2015,jpp5862,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder.

I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be.

June 2015,flightnurse,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder.

And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

May 2015,dino001,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
May 2015,billyperks4,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

May 2015,dino001,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

May 2015,dino001,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
May 2015,Michaell,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

April 2015,rayainsw,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

April 2015,billyperks4,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
April 2015,graphicguy,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
April 2015,roadburner,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

April 2015,graphicguy,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
April 2015,roadburner,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

April 2015,dino001,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
April 2015,robr2,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
April 2015,graphicguy,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

March 2015,Michaell,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
March 2015,Michaell,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."
March 2015,m6user,"Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem."
March 2015,m6user,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
March 2015,stickguy,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
March 2015,stickguy,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.
March 2015,roadburner,"Plus it’s not a lightweight, and us pushing an AWD system."
March 2015,robr2,
March 2015,graphicguy,So what is up with Edmunds these days? logging is a pain..

March 2015,cdnpinhead,Thinking about it....
March 2015,m6user,"Stinger interests me, but not the horrible lease rates."
March 2015,qbrozen,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
March 2015,breld,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
March 2015,robr2,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
March 2015,qbrozen,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
March 2015,robr2,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
March 2015,m6user,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."
March 2015,robr2,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.
March 2015,qbrozen,"May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?"
March 2015,m6user,Funny...I just had this image of feeding vinyl records into the dashboard.
March 2015,tlong,"Oh, you mean like this?"
March 2015,m6user,Yeah but the BIG ones.
March 2015,markcincinnati,You asked for it …

March 2015,markcincinnati,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
March 2015,flightnurse,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

March 2015,sweendogy,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
March 2015,roadburner,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
March 2015,robr2,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
March 2015,roadburner,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
March 2015,nyccarguy,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."
March 2015,Mr_Shiftright,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.

March 2015,flightnurse,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
March 2015,benjaminh,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

March 2015,andres3,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

February 2015,sweendogy,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

February 2015,sweendogy,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
February 2015,andres3,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
February 2015,sweendogy,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

January 2015,flightnurse,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
January 2015,andres3,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

January 2015,cdnpinhead,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

December 2014,brian125,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
December 2014,graphicguy,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

December 2014,ab348,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder.

And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

October 2014,tlong,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!
October 2014,flightnurse,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
October 2014,sweendogy,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

October 2014,markcincinnati,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
October 2014,sweendogy,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

September 2014,Kirstie_H,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
September 2014,graphicguy,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
September 2014,Michaell,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
September 2014,ab348,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
September 2014,stickguy,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

August 2014,dino001,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
August 2014,flightnurse,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder.

And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

July 2014,Kirstie_H,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
July 2014,kyfdx,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

July 2014,robr2,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder.

I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

June 2014,sweendogy,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
June 2014,stever,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

June 2014,kyfdx,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder.

And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

April 2014,flightnurse,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
April 2014,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."
April 2014,andres3,"Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem."

April 2014,nyccarguy,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
April 2014,andres3,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

April 2014,graphicguy,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

April 2014,carnaught,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
April 2014,graphicguy,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."

I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

February 2014,graphicguy,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!
February 2014,ivan_99,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
February 2014,robr2,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."

February 2014,robr2,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
February 2014,flightnurse,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.

January 2014,nyccarguy,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."

I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."

December 2013,graphicguy,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
December 2013,markcincinnati,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year."
December 2013,hercules00,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.  The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
December 2013,carnaught,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
December 2013,markcincinnati,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."

January 2014,nyccarguy,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
January 2014,markcincinnati,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."

January 2014,graphicguy,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but...."
January 2014,kyfdx,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
January 2014,graphicguy,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."

I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs.  A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have.  She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
October 2013,rayainsw,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
October 2013,ivan_99,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
October 2013,flightnurse,"I haven't ruled out the Passat.  I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own.  As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
October 2013,nyccarguy,I have an old friend that just testified to the following:
October 2013,nyccarguy,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but...."
November 2013,graphicguy,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
November 2013,markcincinnati,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."

October 2013,robr2,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
October 2013,m6user,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year."
October 2013,ivan_99,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.  The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
October 2013,flightnurse,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
October 2013,flightnurse,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."
October 2013,flightnurse,"I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me).   I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it."
October 2013,flightnurse,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."
October 2013,flightnurse,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much.  Enjoy the pics, too.  Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX.  But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
October 2013,robr2,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."

October 2013,Michaell,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."

October 2013,cdnpinhead,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
October 2013,graphicguy,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."
October 2013,alltorque,Declining sales last month for most ELL cars means bargains can be found....
October 2013,alltorque,Jag XE didn't even make the list; that can't be good...
October 2013,dino001,"Probably a Jaguar is in a different category higher than ""entry-level luxury."" I just copied and pasted that list that someone compiled. I notice it's also missing the Cadillac ATS, I guess because the ATS is a little smaller?"
October 2013,graphicguy,Jaguar XE sales are down considerably from 2017
October 2013,qbrozen,"""Danger Will Robinson!"""
October 2013,rayainsw,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX."
October 2013,sweendogy,"What classes do you teach?  I wonder if the standard audio in the TLX is better than the current Accord EXL+ models.  I do wish the standard TLX came with leather instead of faux leather. The higher seating position in the TLX, similar to my Accord is a plus.  I don't like the lower seating stance of the new Accord."
October 2013,graphicguy,I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!
October 2013,Kirstie_H,"I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class.  When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors.  One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII.  The stories and insight that she shared, wow.  I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't."
October 2013,andres3,A pic from today....
October 2013,graphicguy,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
October 2013,robr2,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year."
October 2013,graphicguy,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.  The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
October 2013,robr2,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
October 2013,Michaell,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."
October 2013,rayainsw,"I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me).   I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it."
October 2013,markcincinnati,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."
October 2013,rayainsw,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much.  Enjoy the pics, too.  Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX.  But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
October 2013,andres3,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."
October 2013,markcincinnati,How many miles do you have on the TLX now?  After going on a couple of test rides with
October 2013,andres3,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
October 2013,flightnurse,That says a lot that you've driven it that much.   The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
October 2013,graphicguy,"I will buy another sedan at some point.  Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring,  TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO.  I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs.  A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have.  She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
October 2013,fedlawman,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
October 2013,markcincinnati,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
October 2013,graphicguy,"I haven't ruled out the Passat.  I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own.  As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."

September 2013,skobola,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
September 2013,tifighter,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year."
September 2013,andres3,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.  The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
September 2013,markcincinnati,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
September 2013,andres3,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."

September 2013,tlong,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so.

September 2013,andres3,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much.  Enjoy the pics, too.  Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX.  But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
September 2013,nyccarguy,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."

September 2013,igozoomzoom,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
September 2013,sichin2000,That says a lot that you've driven it that much.   The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
September 2013,flightnurse,"I will buy another sedan at some point.  Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring,  TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO.

She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
September 2013,ivan_99,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
September 2013,andres3,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."

September 2013,graphicguy,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
September 2013,markcincinnati,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."

September 2013,dino001,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
September 2013,stickguy,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."
September 2013,dino001,"I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me).

September 2013,graphicguy,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so.

September 2013,m6user,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much.  Enjoy the pics, too.  Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX.  But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
September 2013,dino001,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."

September 2013,m6user,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
September 2013,dino001,That says a lot that you've driven it that much.   The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
September 2013,Kirstie_H,"I will buy another sedan at some point.  Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring,  TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO.  I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs.  A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have.  She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
September 2013,carnaught,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
September 2013,markcincinnati,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
September 2013,m6user,"I haven't ruled out the Passat.  I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own.  As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
September 2013,puffinalong,I have an old friend that just testified to the following:
September 2013,andres3,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but...."
September 2013,andres3,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
September 2013,billyperksii,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."

The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."
August 2013,igozoomzoom,How many miles do you have on the TLX now?  After going on a couple of test rides with
August 2013,gpb59,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
August 2013,dino001,That says a lot that you've driven it that much.   The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
August 2013,flightnurse,"I will buy another sedan at some point.  Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring,  TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO.  I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs.  A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have.  She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
August 2013,andres3,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
August 2013,sweendogy,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
August 2013,andres3,"I haven't ruled out the Passat.  I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own.  As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
August 2013,dino001,I have an old friend that just testified to the following:
August 2013,andys120,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but...."
August 2013,andres3,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
August 2013,sweendogy,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."
August 2013,markcincinnati,Declining sales last month for most ELL cars means bargains can be found....
August 2013,flightnurse,Jag XE didn't even make the list; that can't be good...
August 2013,sweendogy,"Probably a Jaguar is in a different category higher than ""entry-level luxury."" I just copied and pasted that list that someone compiled. I notice it's also missing the Cadillac ATS, I guess because the ATS is a little smaller?"
August 2013,andres3,Jaguar XE sales are down considerably from 2017
