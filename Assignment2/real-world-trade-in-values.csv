$44k-$45k.

private sale is going to be VERY difficult at this price point. My guess is dealers would be asking right about $50k. So I suppose you could attempt it at $48,995 and probably wind up around $47.5k taking.

something to consider: does your state have tax credit on trades? I know if I trade at $44.5k in NJ, I'd get $3115 tax credit on the new car. That matches what I could hope for on a private party sale and saves me a heap of trouble and effort in the process.","

Even with the dealership willing to take a small loss on the 2017, they could not match the price of the 2018. Never mind beat the price, which is what they would have had to do.

I don't know why they say that. My understanding is that the manufacturers pay out the final incentive, whatever that is, on leftover models directly to the dealer.

Otherwise, just find a low-mileage CPO, which probably has a better warranty anyway.","For whatever it's worth, I looked at some 2017 Infiniti QX70s with my Dad a few weeks back, and even at this point in the 2018 MY, they still hadn't received their final pay from Infiniti for them.","that's a good point. maybe they have to hang onto them until that happens, whenever that may be.","
All I know, I was sitting there, checkbook in hand, ready to make a deal. Which I eventually did, on a new 2018. They flat were not interested in trying to make a deal on the 2017. This dealership has their prices online, and they are fairly firm with those prices. When you first walk in, they try to hit you with some ""dealer add-ons"", but when I tell them to ""throw that out or I walk"", they throw away the dealer add-ons.

Their online prices for the 2017 models were slightly higher than for the equivalent 2018. Which didn't make any sense, thus my saying, ""Make me a deal and you can get rid of one of those 2017 models,"" The salesman told me he couldn't do it (lower the advertised price on the 2017), and they never showed any inclination to try and make that deal.

My thoughts on the subject were basically that the 2017 model needed to be at least $1500 to $2000 cheaper, roughly 5 to 7%. And even with $2k off, it would have been iffy. Now $3k off, and I would have been writing a check.

Not my problem, luckily. I'm very happy with my new 2018, and it was a very good deal. Listening to others in here talk about the prices for the new Tundras makes me even happier with my Ford!","
50% depreciation in 1 MY? Ouch. Pretty sure though haven’t seen any CPO low mile used ones listed nearly that cheap. What they will really take, who knows. I don’t really have the time or enthusiasm though to drive all over trying to haggle one down though.","
Email if you're serious - ask for a sales manager to be added to the thread and make your case. Worst case you waste a few minutes emailing back and forth.","
As a former Volvo lessee I can attest to the massive depreciation. Used they have to be one of the best values out there, but never buy a new one. Never.","There is always a manager involved, that doesn't have a stake in the actual P&L, long term, but does get a bonus, based on his average profit per transaction.

So, while that 2017 keeps depreciating, if he doesn't sell it, it doesn't affect his paycheck. At some point, the company writes down the value, then he can sell it, and not affect his bonus.

Some version of the above, is why sometimes they won't make deals that make actual sense.","that is odd. but explains a lot.

if I wanted it, I would just show up in person and settle in for a nice round of passive-aggressive negotiating (I waffle, they lower the price. sometimes it works),

only real issue is it is about 45 minutes from here, and I can't go this weekend because we are in the process of getting my daughter moved out. That happens saturday. so next week I can start looking","
I don't think that would work in a case like this. If they are in negative territory (already losing money on the deal), and that is going to effect the Manager's bonus, he does not want to do the deal, at all, period.

Doesn't matter if you act passive aggressive, throw a screaming fit, hold your breath until your face turns blue -- if it's going to cost him money out of his take him pay, he does NOT care.","it still makes absolutely no sense from a business perspective. But I have been in the corporate world long enough to realize that dumb decisions are made all the time.

Maybe need to go up the ladder to someone that makes money when they sell units, not sit on them!",I agree about leftover 2017s. My neighbor is a VP of a local dealer group. They have a leftover 2017 4runner at the Toyota store. I told him I was interested if he could discount it more than a 2018 but he said there was no difference in price.

It's as risky as buying a $50K Porsche, out of warranty.

Repairs/maintenance cost on used Porsches is the same as on new Porsches.","It's less risky in that there is less cash outlay to walk (run) away from. Not that you'd want to cut & run after shelling out $15...

The price is about right for the miles, so that's not the issue. Just keep in mind that the cost to repair the engine exceeds the entire value of the car. The Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) is the best $200-$300 you'll ever spend.

There are a number of things to look for in the PPI, some more serious than others. If the car passes the test, then the 996 can be a very good value for the money. But if you have to start repairing major items right away, you will soon be buried in the car.

The bid on a car, without buying one. That's hard to do with a regular dealer, though. That's the attraction.

Plus, even though dealers buy cars at auction, they also get trade-ins on new cars. Since Carvana isn't selling new cars, they miss out on that part. They may get trades on their used cars, but that makes the trade even older, and I'm guessing they have a cutoff point, where they won't take an older car.","Carvana seems to be more-or-less, kinda-sorta like CarMax.

So on one hand it's showing as a 2 owner car, w/ one of them being ""rental"", even though the car was used 3200 miles over 8 months, doesn't feel like a car optioned for rental use, and was sold by a NJ dealer to whoever titled it as a ""Rental"". Then we see a 10 month lease, whatever that may have been (perhaps someone did a CPO lease and/or turned it in early). The final oddity is that we see it listed for sale 3/25/16 w/ 9K miles and again on 1/19/18 w/ 31K miles, with no activity between those dates showing in the carfax.

9,"One other thought - naturally, you're looking at the current value of the Optima versus the lease obligation. But what you really owe is the remainder of the payments, which sounds like roughly 12 months x $200, or $2,400. Lease experts can chime in if I'm wrong, but can't you prepay the remainder of the payments and hand the keys over and turn it in?

I'm not saying that necessarily makes sense, 'cause if you're making the payments, you may as well drive it. But if it's a matter of moving on to something you enjoy more, seems this may be cheaper than trading it since you're just paying it down to the stated residual instead of eating the difference between obligation and market value (which is lower than the residual).","
No.. if you turn in a lease early, you are responsible for the current wholesale market value, and the difference between that and the payoff. Your actual lease payments mean nothing.","I have a question for myself.

I was about to ask the same question, but I finished reading before posting the question. Shaking my head, unbelievable.

That does leave the possibility of trying to get someone to take over the lease, yes? Which would save you the $2,400 in lease payments and the cost of one year's full coverage insurance ( +/- $1,000 ?)

So guessing at $3,400 out of your pocket, you could offer up half of that ( $1,700) as an incentive for someone to take over the lease?","
I'd guess 11-12k...","Depends on the bank... and, if they absolve you of financial responsibility. Some don't.","
Which means what---that you're actually sort of a co-signer for the person who took over your lease?","
What is owed on a lease is spelled out in the contract: The payments, and he car. That's it.

Is there an obligation to hold on to a car for a certain period of time? Why? Who would benefit?

I have twice turned in a GM lease early; once by a couple months and once by half a year, both on 2-year leases. The remaining payments were made beforehand and my obligation was over.

If they had started talking about 'market value' I would have been dumbfounded. I had fulfilled my obligation to make the payments and return the car with the specified miles in the specified condition. What would be the argument? It's now worth less because I didn't age it enough?

Anything is possible in contract law, I guess, but that makes no sense.","Correct. Some of the captives will allow a lease transfer but require you remain on the lease effectively as a co-signer. The most recent case we've heard about is an Infiniti lease transfer, the person who took over the lease died, and Infiniti is holding the original lessee responsible for payments, insurance, and condition of the vehicle.","
Because they can....","Ford's lease contract explicitly said that if we prepaid the payments and returned it before the lease expired, they would sell it at auction. We would owe the difference between wholesale value and our remaining payoff.

Well, they can't stop you from parking it in a cave, with the keys inside, and if it's still there at lease end, you return it. The waste on that is of course the mileage remaining, but it seems some leases/banks are incentivizing dust collectors and paper weights.","

I'm no expert, but my limited understanding was the payoff is what you'd pay had you kept the vehicle for the full duration of the lease:

+Remaining payments
+Residual (since your buying the car in order to ""pay them off"" to get rid of it early
+ Fees/charges/return/disposition costs

By keeping the car until lease end, my payoff becomes:

1) remaining payments spread out monthly
2) No residual unless I want to keep the car, so essentially the residual is my locked-in ""trade-in"" value, effectively.
3) Fees/charges/return/disposition costs
4) Penalties for damage beyond normal wear and tear
5) over mileage penalty if applicable at .20/mile
6) insurance and storage costs until lease end

So if you can't get your residual value trading in a car, you might as we'll keep it in a cave until you can trade it back in for residual value? As long as you are not strapped for immediate cash?","@28firefighter,

They wouldn't sit on it, they'd do what they'd do anyway, take it to auction or offer it to their dealer network online.
They'd just do it N months early, one more car out of ten thousands, who cares?

Generally, the payoff on a lease works just like a car loan. It declines from the adjusted CAP cost down to the residual, along with the payments. The payoff usually doesn't include any monthly finance charges that have yet to occur (which is why it's not residual+payments).

If you are buying your car out of the lease early, or trading it in, then there are likely no penalties levied from the leasing bank. But, if you want to give it back to them for disposal, then you are on the hook for the difference between auction value and payoff.

Not every bank treats it the same way, but your contract is for the lease term. If you want to break it, then you may be penalized. It doesn't have to make sense. It's no different than a penalty for early withdrawal on a bank CD. You want out, the bank uses your problem to make money off of you. It's a time-honored tradition.","
I agree, it doesn't make sense. If anything the manufacturer gets a car back when it's worth more money AND they get still get all the lease payments. When I worked at BMW I inspected cars that were turned in several months early; BMW FS didn't care as long as the payments had all been made.

Thanks, q!

The story is that this gem was bought used by the stepdaughter of a friend of mine.. against advice of counsel, he assures me..

Then they might have not changed the oil for 16k... which isn't good but not in and of itself a huge problem.
The utter failure occurred when the timing chain jumped a tooth or three and destroyed the top end of the engine. This is apparently a feature with this engine and starts with wear of the cam lobe or the cam follower, I'm hazy on the details... and sloppy maintenance gives just that much more opportunity for excess wear.

Regardless, the 'fix' is a $4k used engine with 20k miles, installed bya trusted indy shop. Plus $1k for the warranty. Gotta have the warranty

Before he goes down that road, they wanted to know what the numbers looked like, hence the valuation request. Of course, the happy couple was underwater on this thing back when it actually ran.

s13: There'll be a story to go with this later.

Got some text messages last night from an old friend of mine.
His stepdaughter and husband bought -- against advice of counsel, of course, he knows his stuff -- this '12 Tiguan. Just to make sure it'd get interesting, they didn't change the oil for 16k.

It turns out there is a problem with wear of the cam follower on the cam lobe -- if I got this right -- and it is exacerbated by sloppy maintenance. At any rate, the timing chain jumped a tooth or three and the engine is toast.
A replacement used engeine with 20k is $4,000. Plus another grand for the warranty. This is at a trusted indie shop, so it's either that or forget it and stop the bleeding. Which I'm betting they were underwater on this thing already back when it ran...

So the $6+ valuation makes it a tough decision. Personally, I'd cut my losses, but I have options. My hunch is they'll be better of paying for the repair. WITH the warranty, the way their luck is running. Andn then hold on for a really long time.

Talked about just building a house this year and sell ours next, then we'd have a place already to move into once we sell current one. That's Plan A and sure they'll be many more before we make a decision. Not even sure we'll choose that same area as the wife likes the Port Charlotte area a lot.

The Sandman","I'm trying to figure out what a reasonable or good price would be on a used 2018 bmw X3 xdrive with 500 miles. Dealer says retail price is $57,000. They are asking 48,000, which is a 15.8% discount on the stated retail price. But, the vehicle is truly used (not a demo) with a clean carfax -- titled to an owner in January 2018 and traded back in to the dealer last week. Because it was titled to someone, I assume it's not eligible for a lease deal or new car dealer financing or the various available incentives.

The car has the following options: Driving assistance package, Executive package, Premium package, M sport package, panoramic moonroof, Apple carplay compatible, rear manual side window shades. I'd like all of those options, except possibly the M sport package.


I can pay cash, but would also be willing to finance if the deal was right. If a good price on a loaner is 12-15% off, plus the buyer could get incentives of $1500-$2000, what would be a good price for this used vehicle?

For the asking price of only 16% off on this used vehicle, I think I'd rather go for a loaner for about the same discount and get even more off using the available incentives for a 'new' car.

Also, I plan to ask for the service records of the vehicle before proceeding. I want to know why it was driven so little over 6 months, but definitely have concerns that it's a lemon.

Insights and advice very welcome. I typically buy new, but am intrigued by this vehicle. Thanks.","Sometimes people change their minds on a new car after only a matter of months. It’s crazy, but it happens.","But you’re approaching it exactly right - figure what a new one (or loaner) would cost given current incentives and then figure what a reasonable discount would be for any mileage and the fact that it has indeed been titled and has had a previous owner. And since the savings over a new one may be slim, make sure you’re not sacrificing anything significant with regard to color and option preferences.","It might have a clean Carfax, but you need someone experienced to check it out for previous damage.

That's a good point about the low miles being a big concern. In fact, someone reported their brand new Audi was at the body shop for 4 months waiting for parts after a wreck. Being brand new probably had something to do with it, but no way of knowing if Audi was lagging, or if it was just body shop ineptitude.

My Audi repairs took about 2 months and and I was on top of the shop weekly hounding them to get done.","My Golf was in the collision center a good three weeks but a wasted week was due to the adjuster and her lack of decision making. I had to get involved to get things moving and after that, work got done pretty quickly. It was a close call to either total it or just fix it which called for a brand new door. Since VW doesn't make an SEL model for 2018, happy they fixed it.

Based on this, the Mazda3 is what I should look to get into. I am surprised that you mentioned they are valued around the same at auction given that the Optima SXL starts out so expensive.

It also costs about 400 more per year to insure the 2015 Optima, and would not include mechanical coverage.

He doesn't know. It has been in the shop since he took delivery.","Well, that did not take long. This one I am interested in. Always heard that depreciation on a new one of these could be eye watering.","
I am enjoying the vehicle. I like that it's a bit different in character than the competition, both in aesthetics and driving feel. It’s certainly quiet and smooth, but more in a “trucky” way, if that makes sense.

The diesel really sets it apart. The 0-60 times aren’t anything to write home about, but of course with all that torque, it really pulls strong. That is, once you get through the initial turbo lag, which is significant. And, through 6,000 miles, the trip computer indicates an average mpg of about 26.

I love the interior - the materials are of very high quality, and I really like the seating position and the armrest positions.

It’s hard to separate the car itself from the ownership experience. In a nutshell, my wife was all hot on getting a Range Rover Sport or Velar at some point, but she’s now completely turned off from the brand.

I’ve been driving the wife’s Volvo more often recently, so I’ll get out of that and realize how rewarding a sports sedan (or wagon in this case), is to drive.

The “bedside manner” of the service department just leaves a whole lot to be desired.  And there are fewer choices in dealers than most other makes.

Which means if I were to choose to make a switch, as long as I buy used and buy smart (using the great information you provide), it’s not the end of the world.

But my timing's a bit off as I've decided to give the Hertz gig another year, until the end of 2019 as I'll have just turned 65. With all the miles I put on now, the time to get the Insight would have to be now. But first, I need to test drive one to see if I could live with it on a daily basis. And also need to get a final tally on my medical bills from my gall bladder surgery.
Right now getting a few bills but mostly explanations from my insurance company saying in big letters, ""this is not a bill"" up at the top. So, just need to see where I end up owing and then go from there. Am hoping my out of pocket won't be over $5K to be honest. Will not go into my retirement accounts to pay for any of it so will have to see how it all pans out.

The Sandman","One of the things that you should expect from a luxury brand is a great service experience. In my opinion, the differences between a Chevrolet and a Cadillac (the cars themselves) are not as big, and not as important, as the differences between the dealerships, and most particularly the service departments.

My wife bought a 3 year old Cadillac (with a 4 year warranty) in 2001. So we had a few interactions with the service department, nothing major. I was overwhelmed, in a very positive way. I understood, for the first time, why people would pay so much for a luxury car. All my experiences with dealer service departments up until then had been Mopar, Ford, and Chevy. The difference was truly night and day.

Then, in 2008, my wife bought the new Passat. And the service department at West Houston Volkswagen rivaled the Cadillac dealer. Absolutely outstanding, in every way. I brought in the car once for something minor, and the general manager came out to greet me and ask about my experience. Having had a little experience in management, I asked him how he achieved that level of excellence, day in and day out.

He said something along the lines of, “It’s simple, really. I pay the most, and I expect the most, and I stay on top of it.

Interesting, I hadn’t encountered that information (8 speed automatic in the Silverado). I recently looked at one (an advertised special), 2018 Silverado 1500 LT Texas Edition (nicely equipped) for $31k. It definitely had the 5.3L and the 6 speed. After reading your post, I did a quick google search. It seems GM has had an 8 speed automatic available in their trucks for the last 2 years, but they are still selling (mostly?) trucks equipped with the 6 speed. I found one thread where it was stated that only the LTZ (upper trim level) came with the 8 speed.

And I saw several threads with people having problems with the programming of the 8 speed, and others discussing how the 8 speed seemed to be a tad slower 0-60. And yes, they are going to offer a turbocharged 2.7L four cylinder, but not until the 2019 model year. I had heard about the new engine, and even read the specifications. Definitely less power (HP and torque) than the Ford 2.7L V6.

I would definitely be interested in the 6.2L V8, but those are pretty rare, only come in the highest trim levels, and you are never going to find an “advertised special” equipped with the the 6.2L.","
Are we talking list price, or street price? A $50k window sticker truck can be had for around $37k right now. And, interestingly enough, the $65k model that you would then expect to be discounted to $50k does not receive near as much of a discount. Probably a lack of factory incentives, due to not as many sold, the supposition that only a rich person would buy it, and those rich people aren't driven by price?

If you're expecting the same 25% off MSRP when you go upmarket, and look at trucks with a window sticker in the $60k to $65k range, you are going to be sorely disappointed.","And don’t even think about a Canyon or Colorado. The MSRP will be considerably less than the equivalent Silverado, but the actual selling price will be considerably higher. No discounts and no factory incentives. Why would they discount? They are apparently still selling them as fast as they can produce them.","


Before my Dad bought his Yukon SLT in April, they had 15% off Yukon Denalis (with the 6.2L V8 & Magnetic Ride Control). The 15% off came to a significant discount off of MSRP (between $10,500 & $12K), but still came out to much MORE than he was willing to spend.","I received an email flyer from the Chevy dealer (the same dealer from whom I purchased my 2011 and 2013 Silverados). New 2018 Silverado Crew Cab 1500, LT, Texas Edition (nicely equipped), MSRP $48k advertised price $30k. I went down and looked at it, that was the unit with the 6 speed automatic. There was one incentive that I did not qualify for, my final price would have been about $31k. Making the discount work out to about 35%. Which kind of dwarfs your %15 number.","

Sorry, yes, $50k msrp. My $48k truck was discounted to about $40k, IIRC, and was worth $32k almost immediately. Not that it matters to me since it is a lease.","
Missed this post the first time around. I don't find the current crop of diesel pickup trucks very appealing. Everything I've read makes me think they are not really intended for hauling or towing. I owned a 2000 F250 with the 7.3L diesel, and really liked the truck. It was too big for everyday use, but it was just the ticket for pulling my 10,000 lb fifth wheel travel trailer. These new 1/2 ton diesels (Dodge, and more recently Ford) seem to be only good for one thing, fuel mileage. And with the small (very small!) number of miles I drive these days, fuel economy is just not on my list of concerns.

And there seems to be a very steep surcharge for the diesel engine, emphasized by the way the dealers (or the factory?) only seem to order up the diesel engine in the very top-of-the-line (read most expensive) models.

I will admit, when I'm tire kicking at a used car lot and run across a late model F250 Lariat, loaded out with diesel and everything but the kitchen sink -- yes, I'm tempted. I walk around it, and think how much I would enjoy taking it out on the road. But then I wake up and remember that it would NOT fit in the parking garage downtown. No way, no how. Add in how these late model diesels have EGR systems that do not like a lot of short trips, and no, it isn't going to happen.","Diesel engines are great, but when they break, they break BIG TIME. Ford has had its fair share of problems with their various diesels.","funny thing, but near me (I walk past both on my normal dog walking routes) are 2 Dodge Ram Eco diesels. And both are white, and lower trim levels (one in my neighborhood even has the black plastic ""hey everyone, look how cheap I am!"" Grille.

Not sure if the other one is the same, but definitely not an upper trim level model.","perfect. an even swap for the Audi!

Kismet.","
I forget, what part of the world are you in? It doesn't show on your posts or your profile. I can assure you there are no lower trim level Eco Diesels here in this part of the world (Houston, TX). Probably because the dealers don't stock them. If you walk the lot, or just browse the online inventories, you will see very few, and the ones you do see are very expensive models.","
I think that in TX, optioned up pickups (or full sized SUVs) are preferred over luxury cars.",Yeah. Cowboy Cadillacs. ,"
It's the same here in Colorado. I live at the edge of the metro area, so there are a number of ranches not too far away. Big dually pickups are the thing to tow horse trailers, RV's and the like.","I'm in NJ. Down near Philadelphia. No clue how easy it is to find cheaper PU models at dealers. Still see plenty of trucks around, but probably not as prevalent as down in Texas. No room to park the darned things up here!","What are auction/trade values looking like for something like...

Since we’re thinking of replacing the i3 with something with more range, we figure we can take advantage of the tax incentives on the EVs and PHEVs and get into something with a low cost of ownership (however short that may be, admittedly).  

$30-32k for a Prius Prime, $35k for a Clarity and probably a little more for a Volt.  

Clarity and Volt get the full $7,500 federal incentive, and the Prius Prime gets $4,500.  Colorado adds another $5,000 for any of the options.  

Obviously can’t predict the future, but based on those values for one year old Prius Primes and Volts, could be a decent proposition.  Not like the VW TDI deal, but still.

In NJ, I'm seeing $32k for the PP and $35k each for the Clarity or Volt. So, really, all are the same figuring the tax difference. It is quite interesting for you, certainly, if you get $12,500 back. That's maybe $25k net after taxes and fees, then drive for a year and trade it for about that, if not a little more.

Personally, the looks alone would keep me away from the Toyota.","Thanks for the feedback Q - that's what the wife and I were thinking.

I always treat them as low-mileage used cars, personally, because that's exactly how it would be treated at trade time.

The most expensive one at auction had 3700 miles and hit $31,400. So $34k, maybe $34.5k seems reasonable to me.","I agree with Q--treat them as very low mileage used cars.

Let's say the dealer received that car in late 2016, in October. So it sits in his inventory until June 2018. No matter how you cut it, it has depreciated 19-20 months worth.

So in my opinion, if you buy that car, even heavily discounted off MSRP as it is, at $34K, and you total it the next day, the insurance is going to offer you about $28K--$29K. If you fight, you might get $31K.","Thanks guys.

Houston, TX","
Is this the one that had all the parts stolen off of it out of your driveway?","No, that was a 2015 Crew Cab, XLT, much more expensive than this Reg Cab XL. They took the hood and the left front quarter panel. I would call it a headlight assembly or light assembly, but the paperwork called it a quarter panel.","
funny, not sure if I mentioned this before, but the CARMAX manager at the San Diego location said that 2 replaced/fixed/repainted panels equaled AUTOMATIC wholesale car, with the appropriate approximate 20% reduction in value.","Well that's CARMAX policy, not necessarily what everyone else thinks.","
True, and it might just be that manager at that location; although I think Carmax strives for the McDonald's appearance and consistency model of car sales.

Still, I don't think insurers and adjusters can get away with discounting their methods as ""not representative of the whole used car market"" since I do believe they hold the title to the nation's largest used car dealer?","Buyers set the market, not CARMAX, no price guides, not dealers, not appraisers----so if buyers enforce that rule, then that's the real world IMO. If they ignore it, then CARMAX is off the mark.

Each used car is different. Applying blanket rules doesn't really work when people are negotiating with each other. If I show you that those two ""accidents"" were headlight damage and the right fender being keyed, how afraid would you be to pay the going price for my car? Probably not too shy about it. And CARMAX would try to get my car for wholesale and turn right around and explain how superficial the damage really was to the next buyer. You can count on that.","


Paperwork with line item estimates would go a long way, but remember, for that statement to mean anything, your customer has to have trust, and used car sales isn't a business known for trustworthiness.

It's just ""easier"" for a buyer to outright ignore accident damaged vehicles. That's one of my DV arguments. Smaller market to market to. For example, in my case, I couldn't market my vehicle to Audi dealerships as a possible CPO sale. I was out of the ""certified"" market.","I traded in that 2015 F150, with two panels replaced. Two different dealerships evaluated the car at EXACTLY what Qbrozen told me it was worth. And I showed both of them the paperwork from the repair. Either it doesn't count if the parts were stolen (versus the car being in a wreck), or Carmax is full of it.

I suspect a little of each. I know that I, as a buyer, would look more harshly on a wrecked car than on one where the hood was stolen. Especially in this case, where I am fairly certain the thieves were professional body repairmen. They unplugged all of the wire harnesses. You would think, working in the dead of the night, stealthily, they would just cut the wires. Nope, every single wire harness was neatly unplugged. And no bolts, nuts, washers, screws lying around. They took everything, and they took it neatly.

And they were able to unlock the truck, in order to pop the hood, without leaving a mark. Like I said, professionals.","henryn said:

And it drives just like new so while I'm still looking to trade, the reality is that I'll just keep it until years end as I have no problem purchasing the last week of the year when most folks aren't buying a new vehicle. December 30th or 31st works for me but since I won't take any new vehicle home the same day, December 30th looks to be my sweet spot. And hopefully, dealers won't mind moving another unit before years end.
Luckily, I don't have to do anything as it's not a need. Sure I want something new but in reality, it's not needed which is what I hear from the wife. So if I do or don't, all works for me! Just hope the recent accident won't ding me too badly. It's already on CarFax I've been told so we'll see how the trade offers go as not just going to give it away. Hell, I own it outright so time's really on my side here.


The Sandman","Don't know how it works in Florida, but here in KY if you buy a vehicle in Dec it will likely cost you a lot of money. Here we do not pay property tax on a car in the year of purchase, just sales tax. So, if you buy a $50K car in December you will owe about $600 in property tax the next year. If you wait until Jan for the purchase you will have one less property tax bill over the life of the car. Other states probably have different rules.","jwm40517 said:

So how do they value the property? Does the bill go down each year as it depreciates?","Blue book wholesale, I think. Yes, it gets cheaper as the car gets older.","NJ taxes the heck out of you (especially if you own a house) but at least they don't screw you with personal property tax. Just pay your (ridiculous) 6.875% sales tax, and get your registration, and be good for years.","qbrozen said:

Here in CT, the property tax goes down every year.  Different towns have different personal property tax rates.  It could cost you more money to own a car in a less affluent area.","So, really, it doesn't matter when you buy it, right? If it decreases each year, you'll have, let's say, 6 yrs of somewhat significant value no matter what. ","Makes it sound appealing to find, say, a leftover 2018 model, in January, 2019, then when you pay taxes on it in 2020, they’re based on the book value of a 2018 vehicle on January 1, 2020. ",I'd personally prefer to not suffer 2 yrs of depreciation in 1 yr just to save $100 on taxes.,"Here the property tax is based on what you own on Jan 1 of each year, even if you sell it later in the year. If you buy in December you will always have one more year of taxes. That first year will always be more because the value is based on a month old car instead of a 13 month old car. But that's just our KY system, your results may vary.","No property taxes on cars or most things in IL. Just around $100 a year for registration.

Of course our property taxes on housing are second highest in the country so what one hand gives, the other takes.","yeah, I would be happy to spend $1,000 in personal property tax on my car, to save the $12,000/year property taxes on my house.","
If you are replacing a car with another car, on the same day (in KY), then it doesn't matter. You are still paying tax once per year. But, if you have the opportunity to sell a car in late December, and pick up the next one after January 1st, you can save a year of property tax.

I did that once.. I bought a car from a dealer in Chicago on December 20th, with 30 day tags. The current car lease was up on January 4th, but I turned it in on December 30th to the dealer, and took the tags to the county clerk that day, to get it off the property tax rolls. Waited until the next week to register the car I bought on December 20th, and skated on property taxes for one vehicle (in 2004). Woo hooo!! I'm still counting that $350, every day.

We still have property taxes on our real estate... though, not as high as NJ.","We get the tax savings when trading in a vehicle but pay a auto tag fee yearly, I usually do it for two years as there's no savings, they just double the amount. Rather not be bothered every year to be honest. When I went back in October, I got a new handicapped placard, the blue one, but also have a handicap plate on my vehicle since we don't always take my vehicle, I need the blue one also. The clerk there told me I've got two years left on the current tag, seems we get a new tag every ten years. The A3 and the Versa got new tags this year and makes sense as the Versa was bought in 2009 and was time for a new tag. I'll get mine in 2020 but not sure I'll still have the Golf at that time...highly doubtful!!

Close to all of it, according to Buffett. Some companies will accept a slight loss in order to get the premium and be able to invest it. ","""theoretically"" ooookay....","Was on one site earlier and it saw my CarFax and priced my vehicle at under $9K which is ludicrous to be honest. It looks brand new and drives like it used to, no noises or creaks or any weird noises. I hit the accelerator and go, hit the brakes and it stops. The brake pedal is a tad low but might be because I need new brakes up front after reaching 40K plus. With the traffic here, tend to use my brakes more with the stop and go nonsense even on the expressway. The route I take is used by thousands of others also going into Miami from the western suburbs. Especially in the evening, it’s bumper to bumper where the speed limit is usually 70 mph, crazy as that may seem.

Depends on how good a job the appraiser does on the DV report. His competence will pretty much determine the outcome. So if he submits evidence + testimonials, that'll all help. If he just guesses, then not so much.","

I should!. Its not as bad as it looks. It is a 2016, but was purchased in Sept 15, so I'm over 2.5 years, under 3. Honestly, what is driving me now is 1) bumper to bumper is ending and thinking that may be a little selling point, having some bumper to bumper left. 2) I'm interested in a Forester XT (turbo), and that is going out of production over the summer, since they discontinued the turbo with the new model.

Ah! I love the candy red color (believe it or not, my old Econoline van was nearly the same color, called ""candy apple red,"" in 1971!).

Yes a DV report could/should include other damaged vehicles of a similar type and value; testimonials from used car dealers or from auctions; and legal rulings made recently which might affect deliberation of DV claims; detailed description of the damage and a ""grade"" as to severity, explaining precisely what is meant by ""panel"", or ""structural""; copies of the body shop work order that might show frame damage or frame straightening.

Stuff like that. A ""bad"" DV report would be more along the lines of the appraiser's ""opinion"" or the use of some obscure ""table of percentages"" that someone made up.","Thanks so much, figured by now it would show up. My diminished value case is moving along, the guy came and saw my car when I was in the hospital and have not heard a word. My kid works at the law firm so when they hear, she’ll let me know. Have decided to keep it since I’m in no condition to test drive or even make such a big decision right now. Just took it for a spin around the block, as I need to get my driving legs back. Went well even though it was pouring. Petrol prices are hovering around $2.75 to $3.00 right now and have no clue why they’re so high to be honest? With summer almost here, would’ve thought them prices would’ve dropped a bit down to the $2.65 range. Since I’ve been home since May 1st, haven’t needed to put any petrol into the Golf as only my son drove it for those few days he was in town.
So right now, plan is to keep it until I feel well enough to test drive something else. Just hope it’s not dinged to badly once I do trade it. It looks great a ddrives great for a vehicle with 40500 on the clock.

The Sandman","What's sad is most people first learn about diminished value when they are trading in a recent model upscale car and suddenly lose $5-$6K (or more) in their trade-in offer, which is obvious, and noticeable.

It takes incurring a loss to learn about it usually.","People who are victims of some other driver's carelessness shouldn't have to suffer DV.

The problem with DV is that it is ill-defined and not well understood. If your new Nissan Versa gets its bumper dented, there's no DV. If your Ferrari gets t-boned, there is massive DV.","
Yes, but it seems Insurance does a good job of keeping DV on the down low

I don't see that Ferrari vs. Versa phenomenon as being any different than getting a 50% offer on a 2-year old totaled Dodge while getting almost all your money back on a 2-year old totaled Honda. Depreciation varies, why would DV be any different.","Insurance companies aren't real big on promoting items that might increase the money paid out for claims.

Not sure why anyone would be surprised at that.","Some cars are far more sensitive to DV than others, was the point.

True, a percentage of DV is a %---so the dollar amount on a Versa DV will no doubt be less than on an Accord.

But the % is not uniformly applied to all cars nor to all types of damage.","Not even sure how DV workers, just know they came and inspected my Golf a few weeks ago today. Haven’t heard back yet about what it all means. But hopefully will get some restitution as none of this was my fault, just at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Perhaps a law stating the tables and rules and equations that'll be used to determine DV will be final and binding, would make it easy for Insurance companies to appropriately price the risk, and make money off it.

I tried to come up with a simple equation, and it actually isn't so simple. Still, a mathematician could do it.","
If the insurance company is making money off of it, where do you think that money comes from?","Sandy, the new Jetta is up to 185"" long. It is a big car. Especially by your standards.","speaking of the new Jetta, we stopped and checked them out today. Daughter drove it. I rode in the back (in case of attack?).

first impression, it looks like a Jetta, at least from the nose, but much different from the side. Looks a lot bigger (only 3"" at most though in length really). Much more stylish looking. I liked it though, lots of style lines.

interior is a big upgrade. Especially the tech features. Very roomy. Rode nice. Daughter said it drove better than her 2015. Not as fast as the Elantra, but moved along fine. Probably comparable to the 1.8t sport.

very well equipped. We drove an R line. Could get by with an SE, but she liked the 2 tone seats. Also comes with 17"" wheels, and an electronic LSD. Comes with LED headlights, auto Climate, heated seats, BLI/cross path, auto braking, car play, pano moonroof, keyless entry/go, and some other stuff that slips my mind. But has everything you really need.

I wanted to get home (we were down in Delaware), and are not going to buy for about 3 months, so I did not bother to drive it but will at some point to see how it drives.

overall though, an impressive car.","Sounds like a nice vehicle and if I have to do 185"", just means it'll take up most of my side. I like VW and not so sure I want to look elsewhere to be honest at this point. And since I love having a warranty, theirs is like the best going forward so why not. The two-toned seats sound interesting and think I'll go again with a lighter interior, as there is no gray which is my first choice. Not sure I'd do blue this time and white's nice but since the A3 is white, won't do the same. A dark gray is my #1 right now but will see when the time comes.
Still want to check out Hyundai/Kia and see what they got. The Kona is growing on me as is the Elantra Limited and both hybrids. A friend has the Elantra Limited and I'd swear it was a Sonata when it was in our driveway in March, it looked that good. I hear the Elantra hybrid has that crazy dual rear window which seems ridiculous to me but will withhold judgement until I drive one.
As much as I like MB and BMW, a bit on the expensive side and not really the vehicle for me. I want a long warranty and a smaller size vehicle with somewhat decent mpg's which narrows the playing field substantially. But that's o k because am happy with VW or either of the Korean cousins, On paper, the Ford Ecosport is a 100% match but have to drive one first to see...and need to get over that aversion to anything Ford. Have sat in one a few times at the dealer and liked it, has Sirius/XM and all the controls were where they should be. Ingress/egress was pretty good to be honest with just a slide in and slide out so no spinal problems I could see. The Titanium edition was nice and would give me the Sirius/XM I desire but the mpg's were a bit low. But it's on the short list. Just wish Honda would fix the HR-V issues, the lack of radio knobs and the lack of low end grunt but hoping they address these issues with the new model whenever that will be. They did it on the CR-V and assume they'll do the same with the new HR-V. If so, it could be ""the one"" as I like Honda's and they are ""cheap to keep""

The Sandman","I still think you will really like the Kona. Seems to fit your desires to a ""T""","Yes, you've said that before and since we seem to have similar desires in the vehicles we like, gonna go with you on this. I do like the way they look also, a bit out there for some but I'm o k with it. That and the Elantra GT I need to try. Saw a GT the other day and I liked the way it looked. Remember you said you liked the way it drove, with good low end torque, so it'll get up to speed quickly when needed. And having the Hyundai dealer just across the street from the Audi store means we're super close to home if service is ever needed. Add to that their great warranty and I could have a winner here.

Argh! The timing!!!!","
Funniest thing.... Yesterday, my wife was talking with my son about things he might want to do this summer. He pauses for a minute or so, at first contemplative, and then clearly just afraid to speak his mind. She finally coaxed him into voicing his thoughts, and he says, ""Well, I would really like to drive."" !?!

This is the same kid that is usually lost in some circuit board or leisure-reading Fine Homebuilding and Make! magazines. I thought for sure that I would have to coax him into learning to drive before he flies the coop in a few years, not jumping headlong into the process at fourteen.

In Alaska, children can test for the learner's permit at fourteen and provisional license at sixteen. The provisional license has some restrictions, IIRC, such as times of day and passengers, etc. I don't recall all the details. Anyhow, picking up a driver manual from DMV is on my list of things to do this week.

He is still three weeks away from the 'big' 1-4.

But, now I have to get serious about making sure the van is up to the task of helping a new driver learn how to actually drive a vehicle. I'll leave the cheating of modern vehicles to later in the game (once he knows how to drive).","You guys are funny. I'll show her these. Hellcat!

FWIW, the MI graduated license system is GREAT. Beyond what the state does, there was some cheesy slip she got after, like, three hours of classroom instructions and a couple of driving lessons. It came before the official graduated license and I think it was a local deal. The only thing ""official"" about it was the instructor's signature.

It had instructions for the parents: Stay in neighborhoods, go slow, avoid peak traffic times, stay off the freeways, but practice driving. I thought it made sense.

What really made me think is when Sophie was ten or so, I showed her how to ride a bicycle in traffic. That made me realize how much goes into just a slow ride through the neighborhood. Who has the right of way? Where do you have to look for trouble? What happens when THAT guy doesn't see you? There is so much we do in traffic without thinking about it that's not obvious.

Another one was four-way stops -- it had not occurred to me how even a half second of hesitation gets everyone confused. So I told her, your behavior is your communication. Show them what you're going to do. We have four uneventful years now; three on her own. I'm convinced that biking to school from 7th grade onward made a big difference. A stick helps, too. Try texting with that.","I know I sound like a broken record, but my advice is to send your child to streetsurvival.org/ at a minimum.
If you can afford it, send them to a 1 or 2 day teen driving school- one that actually teaches them how to drive. A good list of such schools can be found here. We sent our son to the 2 Day Teen School at the BMW Performance Center. It was worth every penny.","
Great advice, though. Even with the best of parental instruction, teens often learn much more from instructors who are *not* their parents, and different perspectives can open up a whole world of understanding for them.","What was the dollar amount of the damage?

The insurance company paid $8000. This was mainly due to how new it was and that it was all new parts directly from Subaru. There were no junkyard or aftermarket parts at the time. Also the LED headlights were close to $2K of that. Needed primarily a hood, bumper, headlights and the fenders. It sounds a bit worse than it was and i have pictures. It was a 20-25mph accident where someone ran a stop sign on me and I hit them broadside. Obviously I can't do much about the carfax now.


Depending on how much you get for the car, it looks like you'll suffer somewhere between a $1,000 and $6,000 loss due to diminished value. That amount you should have gone after from the insurance company (usually the 3rd parties as it was their fault).

I'd hope in a newer car that junkyard or aftermarket parts were not used. That would defeat the purpose of a repair in the first place.

yeah I get that. I tried pursuing diminished value at the time of the accident, I just hit walls with the insurance company and got nowhere. I dropped it finally, the next step was small claims. I was just tired getting the car repaired, dealing with the kids, back and forth on the comparative negligence, do I get 10% of the fault, 15%, 20%, I settled on 15%.","


How much do you owe on it?  How come you want to ditch it?  Glad you didn’t get hurt.

In 2002 dollars, I was able to avoid a crap box by spending $3,500 plus taxes and fees, by buying from a used car dealer, sticking to Honda, and going with high miles (166K). Also, he had receipts for a few things showing he put some effort into reconditioning the car wherever it had some faults.","
He's over-asking at $4K, you make a strong offer of $3K, and he wants to sleep on it? Crazy, if you ask me. Unless it just went on sale within the last 36 hours.","
Actually, Michigan is an odd State, they have educated law enforcement people in power, particularly in the State Highway Patrol force, that advocate for things like smart speed limits based on safety, science, and statistics, rather than myths, revenue, and fear-mongering.

They are advanced and 1st world, which unfortunately, I can't say the same of most States in the USA, at least when it comes to traffic laws and enforcement.

One of those ""advanced"" forms of knowledge comes from understanding the problem with 16 year-olds learning how to drive for the first time isn't that they are 16, but that they have 0 years of experience. Studies show 19 year-olds with 0 years experience do just as badly. 19 year-olds with 3 years experience tend to do just as well as a 22 year old with 3 years experience behind the wheel.",">> smart speed limits based on safety, science, and statistics,

Let's not get carried away with all the science... pull up a chair and let Uncle Mathias tell you a little story.

Here in town [East Lansing], there are two roads that are governed by the state; one a major throughfare [Saginaw highway] that was always at 35 mph, and then ""Grand River,"" which is an old plank road dating back who knows how long that cuts clear across Michigan East-West. That one was at 25 everywhere in town, which brought smiles to ticket writers and revenue generators, but also made for a pleasant ride, as I bike along it regularly, during my so-called ""commute""... both miles of it

Anyway, Grand River goes right through the city and forms the border between town and university, and the speed limit downtown is today and always has been 25 mph.

Enter the state legislature, citing ""safety and science"" and a study saying you should just put your speed limit at the 87th percentile or whatever the heck the study said. So they put the two roads at 45and 35 mph, respectively.. except for the very downtown mile of Gd River, of course.

Drivers were kinda shell-shocked and for quite a while drover UNDER the speed limit, esp. at the 45 mph end.
However, the city sued, there were arguments, there was judicial whatnot, and soon enough, the limits are back where they had been..

...Until the whole thing wound up in the Michigan Supreme Court or wherever the final ruling happened, and sure enough, it's back to 45/35 a second time. At this point, all of us have 100% lost any respect for speed laws -- I know I have. Especially since the cops disappeared as soon as the limits went up. Both times

Accident rates increased, by the way. People didn't miraculously get a lot quicker and smarter because of some percentile speed. The study that car people like to cite is from the sixties, it turns out, and was taken in rural areas. It has NOTHING to do with in-town driving but it is handy if you want to speed things up.

This was a really stupid fight. Just splitting the difference at 40/30 mph would have been just fine. Keeping in mind there are actual single-family houses with actual driveways on both roads. But compromise isn't what we're all about. Apparently.

>> they are 16, but that they have 0 years of experience.

Well not if you put them on bicycles they don't. It really helps with the learning curve. But I'm just riding a hobby horse of mine...","Your posts are always interesting, my man. The 10K and 40K posters (moderators excepted) fall into a different category. Anyway, thanks.","
It's not just one study from the 60's though. There are numerous studies. The 85th percentile (not 87) is a tried and true ""optimum"" that has been proven over and over throughout the decades, even before the 60's I think.

I don't think most people had any respect for speed laws before, so no love lost there. Let's address your real issues:

1) Of course the cops left when the speed limits were realistically set. People don't disobey realistically set speed limits, so the job of a speed ticket-writing officer becomes pointless. Don't you think the whole scam is a little self-serving to make their own jobs seem worthwhile or useful?

2) Just because the speed limit is 45 or 35 doesn't mean you have to drive the speed limit all the time. You are allowed to go slower, in fact, most States let you go significantly slower than the speed limit. In fact, you can always drive reasonably and prudently given conditions. The speed limit is not a mandate. Although it can seem that way when set too low. I chalk this one up to bad habits and customs from badly set previous laws. It's not the new improved speed limit's fault here!

3) Did the accident rates actually increase? Or did the traffic increase due to higher and more utilitarian speed limits. Higher speed limits would attract more drivers and cars as now the road serves a greater benefit for getting from A to B faster. If traffic flow increased then increased accidents becomes moot unless the RATE actually did increase? Where they able to isolate for when the limits were lowered? Lowering speed limits would tend to cause an increase in wrecks if lowered below the 85th percentile. That must of been one strange City lawsuit!

4) The 85th percentile is by its very definition a compromise that you seek. Offer a study that says the 80th or 75th percentile is safer and more efficient, and we'll talk about it. Otherwise, it's not up for debate in my view.

5) One Exception: IF surveys show an unusually high accident/collision/fatality rate for a certain stretch of road as compared to national averages, perhaps there can be further compromise.

6) I've found the places where I'm ticketed for speeding are always (not mostly, but always in my small sample size) zones with particularly EXTRA safe collision/fatality rates per million miles traveled. The two studies I remember were 1/6th and 1/8th as dangerous as the average roadway; yet it seems they have 6 or 8 times the enforcement on them, and of course, the speed limit is under the 85th percentile! go figure!

You mean what I always suspected about traffic enforcement and speed laws as the truth from general observation was supported by the Traffic and Engineering surveys? Yes! They say there is genius in noticing patterns and anomalies others might miss. Fortunately, I think the ""speed kills"" myth and mantra is so obviously false to most people, that most people vote with their right foot on the accelerator. No genius required.","Changing gears here.. to used-car values, of all the crazy topics...

I was wondering what the real world value is of my car. 2016 WRX STi base model. 20K miles. WR Blue. it has an accident on the car fax noting frame damage. The accident was a front end accident, fully repaired with new subaru parts had literally 1 hr on the bill for frame pulling for the radiator support.
Hmmm...well a radiator support isn't frame damage, so there might have been more to it, or the data was entered wrong. Do you have a VIN you can post? We'll take a look at it.
Hi, the Vin is below. JF1VA2M65G9810636 Thanks Chris
Okay Thanks. The CARFAX report is pretty demonstrative on the damage. It says: Damage reported after accident Structural damage reported Damage to front Damage to left front Damage to right front Perhaps Q can do the math on this one, but given how relatively new it is, it's going to scare a lot of buyers away. If you have a detailed repair order that can clarify matters for the buyer, that might lessen the value hit somewhat--but I suspect the deduct is going to be substantial here. What was the dollar amount of the damage?
Oh boy. Well... this is kind of a gut evaluation. If we're talking trade-in, even if repaired perfectly, I'm gonna say $21k-$22k. Now, if you sell it yourself, due to the desirability by young men of little means, I think it wouldn't get hurt SO bad because they'd be happy to save a couple grand (remember, this is just my gut talking), so I'd try pricing it at $27,495 or $27,995 and take the first $26k offer. 

Point of reference, fair retail for a clean one would be $30k.
Thanks. I was kind of hoping that the trade in value would be around the $26K you're tell me I should take, but I do understand the situation here.
How much do you owe on it?  How come you want to ditch it?  Glad you didn’t get hurt.

Kid & I went to look at a '12 Fiesta/hatch/stick/144k at a dealership on Thursday. Asking $3,900, Q pegged it at $1,500-$2. Good to drive, 5'0 daughter loved the seating position, but it was a rat. Trans whined in 1st and 5th, bad smoker's car, fan only works on high ($10 reostat, seriously?), radio doesnt work at all. no thanks but an educational experience.

Yesterday it was time for an '11 Fiesta/sedan/stick/177k from the original owner. Asking $4(!) but recently serviced with timing belt and water pump. Plastic cracked in front, dent in trunk lid from backing into his other car a bit, plastic not quite lining up. Otherwise, fantastic. Tight, drives great, has cruise, gear whine in 5th is there but you have to listen for it, felt like 44k miles less than the first car, not 33k more. Both cars have camshafts that look not only clean but NEW, I guess that's what 12k synth oil changes will do. No sign of body work -- never mind it could use a little.

Both cars have rust under the hood and other places from the 4-month-a-year salt batch. Highway miles are great for the engine, but dog miles for the rest of the car.

The owner makes it a selling point that he just had replaced the windshield -- I asked him why that should matter to me, I didn't crack the old one, well the old one was a little hazy when you drove into the sun. I reckon if you sand it against kicked-up dirt on Michigan's highways for nearly 200k, that happens. Crypt, indeed.

We talked price, I offered him $3 pending a safety inspection -- my mechanic is a couple miles away -- but no nickel-and-diming. He said he had to sleep on it; his truck was old and he didn't mind the spare car. OK then. Oh yeah: He's around sixty, pleasant to deal with, an engineer by trade(*).

I think he did me a favor, because I will rescind my offer. For $3, there are not many better choices -- well except maybe $2,850 asking for the '98 Lexus I posted a few days ago -- but for a little over $5, I'm looking at half the miles and fewer years. I really like this little car, and my daughter does too, and it's one I feel confident buying without an inspection if I have to. Very simple, VIN stickers everywhere, valve train visible, and what else is there?

The left rear tail light is cracked and taped over. Something is dripping onto the ground. You smell coolant somewhere.

2. The kind you buy and it seems to run pretty well (probably Japanese or old domestic) but it always wants something, seemingly once a week. Nothing truly major, but each ""something"" requires an agonizing decision of whether its better to ""fix it or live with it""? And, of course, you don't really want to take it on any kind of long trip. It's a grocery getter. You wouldn't take it to a job interview and your wife or girlfriend hates it.

3. The kind you regret buying a few days after you made the purchase. Things you weren't told about come to light. You didn't notice the AC compressor belt was disconnected. That little noise in the muffler is actually the catalytic leaking. The CEL suddenly turns on. One tires is nearly flat. The back doors don't open from the inside. There are annoying rattles you didn't hear the other day. It seems to burn oil. The timing chain rattles when cold.

The insurance company paid $8000. This was mainly due to how new it was and that it was all new parts directly from Subaru. There were no junkyard or aftermarket parts at the time. Also the LED headlights were close to $2K of that. Needed primarily a hood, bumper, headlights and the fenders. It sounds a bit worse than it was and i have pictures. It was a 20-25mph accident where someone ran a stop sign on me and I hit them broadside. Obviously I can't do much about the carfax now.","























Oh boy. Well... this is kind of a gut evaluation. If we're talking trade-in, even if repaired perfectly, I'm gonna say $21k-$22k. Now, if you sell it yourself, due to the desirability by young men of little means, I think it wouldn't get hurt SO bad because they'd be happy to save a couple grand (remember, this is just my gut talking), so I'd try pricing it at $27,495 or $27,995 and take the first $26k offer. 

Point of reference, fair retail for a clean one would be $30k.

Depending on how much you get for the car, it looks like you'll suffer somewhere between a $1,000 and $6,000 loss due to diminished value. That amount you should have gone after from the insurance company (usually the 3rd parties as it was their fault).

Over the last week, I've found exactly TWO manuals that are worth considering, and they are both at dealerships.
One good thing about those is they actually know what stuff is worth, unlike the private sellers around here who seem to have gong colletively crazy, e.g. 2000 Jetta TDI 5sp with 293k for $4000. Good luck with that.

Right about $3k auction on the VW. They may move another $500, but possibly not more than that. It is a handshaker, however.

Even in nice shape, its a $7500-$8k trade. Assuming the repairs went well, we're still going to knock it down to $6500. Take off another $500 for the moonroof (assuming they test it). So $6k'ish.

11.9 is pretty darned fair. That's 2500 over auction value, which is typically my target when shopping. If it has any needs, start deducting.

The new Cruze got shot down because once Mademoiselle is back at school, it's another car we don't need. Or so I'm told.

OK then. Viable manuals are exceedingly thin on the ground. There's an '11 Jetta SE with 141k that looks clean for $5k asking price at a rural dealer.... an hour away. I mean, really? Looks clean, though.

I honestly don't think the manuals are *that* unpopular; what happened is they went sub-critical. Not readily available and not that big a deal to most folks. Now young people who are so inclined cannot find cars to learn on. There is a minor backlash where sticks actually sell pretty fast under the right conditions.. but it's too little too late. Compared to things that really matter, this isn't a big deal but it's kind of sad.

I just found another -- 2012 Fiesta 'SE' -- the one with cruise control and power windows -- plus it's a hatchback -- 141k miles, clean history, asking $3,900. At a Dodge dealer 20 minutes away. I guess we'll see if we like it.

^^ well said, was just looking for a vehicle for my son... anything halfway reliable and decent under $10k... eye-opener these days. I might go ahead and say $10,000 is the new $5,000...","
Have you looked into leasing a car for him? There are A LOT of cars out there that you can lease for between $200 & $250 per month. At $250 per month plus up front fees and disposition fees you are right at around $10K for 3 years with ZERO repair costs & ZERO headaches. Just a few oil changes and tire rotations. A few of our members have done that for their college aged children (@breld & @stickguy).","I highly recommend it. If the travel distance is long (my kid was 450 miles away), parking situation is reasonable, they gave a regular need for it at school too, and they are responsible. In our case, all 4 applied.

heck, you can even do better than that with some of these hackr deals. I've seen Terrains and Encores for well under $200.","
Don't think I haven't been looking into that to shuffle some money around. Some of the Q50 deals were nuts last month, they are higher this month, but still good. If I could get into 2 hackr deals with 10K per year each (or a 10K & 12K), it would make my day. Problem being I like the fleet right now and don't want to be in a position to drive a nice car like the Q50 for 6 months and then a penalty box for the other 6. My Prelude obviously isn't going anywhere, I've got a little less than 2 years to pay off the Q40 (and I like it as a daily driver), and the Pilot (2017 AWD Touring, 7K miles, Obsidian Blue/Grey Leather) is perfect for our family (although I wish I could pull the $10,500 out of it I put down back in December).","

My oldest took the family TL with him. The house he lived in (and the parking) was a non starter for a new car. And, it was a real nice car, even with the 160K or so on it. And he was only about 240 miles away! and a boy, to be sexist. and the drive was not so horrible (princess takes the death ride on I95 through DC).

anyway, 1st 2 years, great. no issues. senior year, it started having problems. Alternator died. A coil pack died. Multiple tows. Got stranded an extra day at the end. Thankfully all the problems happened local, not on the road. But me trying to deal with getting it fixed from long distance was a nightmare.

I'd imagine you are right though that fussy buyers would scatter like quail at the sight of that CARFAX, but if the car looked and drove very nicely, maybe a 20% nick would suffice for any buyer who just wants to look rich for cheap?

If you see ""structural damage""---that's BAD. But if it says ""involved in a rear end collision, no air bag deployed""--somehow that's not a as frightening.

I was thinking the same about me. ","Hi! We have 2 vehicles--48306-zip-Detroit burbs looking for trade in values.

2011 Honda Odyssey EXL 80,000 miles-- pretty good condition minus some scratches- paid off

2016 Subaru Outback Limited with Eyesight package/Adaptive Cruise, NAV 24,000 miles (36 mo 15k/yr lease) up in August. residual approx $21,500

Have discovered we need an AWD 3 row vehicle for winter/ski/mountain driving and all our gear and growing kids. Love my minivan for road trips but would prefer something a bit more winter hill friendly. The Outback isn't big enough to haul everything even with the roof rack for the ski gear much less bring a friend along.

Ideally-- since we are now spoiled with the fancy tech features on the Outback --we love the Adaptive Cruise Control-- we could find 2 vehicles to replace our current options. Would like a smaller commuter AWD vehicle like the Rogue, Crosstrek etc....and then something like the Traverse or Enclave AWD with Adaptive Cruise. But can't make the numbers work. Willing to lease again for the 3 row vehicle but was quoted $575 for the Traverse that didn't even have the ACC option. -$50/month if we can get an Executive Referral GM with the conquest lease discount. We qualify for a supplier discount and conquest currently. Ascent isn't out til July for comparison. It looks like most Demo deals are FWD and no extras. May have to suck it up for 2 years before the High Country/Avenir trims come off leases. They have a decent size 3rd row and more cargo space behind the 3rd row. Would like to not go over $500/month total.

Pay off the small commuter car quickly (5-7k balance depending on Honda trade in value) and then in about 3 years we will have our first kid driving so we can hand over a gently used car and repeat that process 2 years later for the 2nd kid. OR maybe we are looking at this the wrong way.....better plan/idea?","

We aren’t necessarily getting out early—it’s up in a few months. Our Subaru dealership has been hounding us since February for a trade in/up to a new Outback and they are desperate for used Outbacks  but we can wait til August and simply turn it in. According to them bc we are low on miles we have some equity.   

No no matter what we need to make a decision by August.  

The outback is a bit long/wide so a slightly smaller vehicle would save some garage space and be easier for the kid to drive down the road ","Hmmm....that argument against the Outback doesn't sound very sturdy in the ""real world"". A few inches in a garage seems a minor gain (to me), and if the kid is a good driver, the size difference won't matter--and if he/she is a bad driver, the size difference won't matter either.

How 'bout outfitting the Subaru with one of those roof pods?","the outback is a lease so going back anyway, unless they want to buy it out. Not the same as selling a paid off van.","Well if the car is doing 95% of what they want it to do, and if the buyout is good.....","Nothing kills a good lease deal quicker than buying it out, at lease end.

It's not your car.. you don't own it... don't feel any obligation towards it. It has to be a better deal than every other comparable car on the market to make that worthwhile.","Ascent is at many dealerships already, in terms of being able to look at them in person. They go on sale in July, though that is rather perfect timing in terms of your Outback's lease end. You should consider looking at one if you have been happy with your Outback.

For your Honda, if you want to maximize your return, consider private sale on that. I think Q said about $11K on trade, so you could probably hit another couple grand on a private sale without too much difficulty. Picking up a smaller AWD vehicle, particularly lightly used, after that sale would probably not cost you a whole lot out of pocket. Well, unless it is a Crosstrek... you might as well get that new for all the ""savings"" you will net.","
Well, if any car is able to make that a reality, it is an Outback. If the residual on that car is $21.5K, they have a chance to come out ahead: Even on trade after a buyout!","Equity on a lease is rare, but it does happen.","
Odyssey is a charcoal shade so should be a safe. I’ll check local sale options/climate. This is ground zero for US car company employees and suppliers so the foreign car market isn’t as lucrative here.

We test drove an Atlas yesterday and checked out the Rogues next door. The VW dealership which is the same “brand” as the Subaru dealership a few doors down from where we leased said we could probably make a few grand be they are short on used Subs. The Atlas was a great drive I just don’t like the 2 3 2 seating configuration! I prefer the 3 seats in the 3rd row these tween girls are loud and obnoxious!","
Truer words were never spoken!","
The width of the vehicle just isn't there in the 3rd row. Our Pilot is configured 2-3-3. You need 3 very skinny children to sit 3 across in the 3rd row.","
I completely agree. Most of the three-row machines are similar. I would rather that manufacturers be honest about their ""seats"" than simply set the layout to suggest you can fit more than is practical. One thing I absolutely love about the Ford Flex is that it says it can seat seven and will do so with a high degree of comfort (even for full-size adults) in any seating position within the car.","

35,Only advice I would have is for you to test drive a 370Z and see if it's worth reaching a bit. I think in the U.S. the first year was 2009. The 370Z is considerably changed from the 350Z.,"370z coupe was in the running at the time I bought the Mustang. I never drove one, but they look nice.","370Z is 100% out of budget, so if I decide to wait and up the budget, I definitely will.

My wife has latched onto getting rid of the C300 now no matter what, so now I have to try and flip that too. ","Honestly I love it. I've loved driving it. I'm the only owner, bought it new in April of 2006. Very reliable. Only issue is that high-performance summer tires need replacing more quickly than you might think. I finally put on some Hankook all-weather tires and have been much happier. If you are an ordinary driver, not a track racer, I would highly recommend getting something like that rather than performance tires.

I'm only trading it in (on a 2016 Audi A5 Cabriolet, because my convertible-loving days are definitely not over) because 1) aging knees and back are telling me it's time to look to the future, and 2) (most important) the Audi can carry four people if needed on occasion, and the back seats fold down so I can carry our dog in his crate to training classes, the vet, whatever.

Life is too short to never own a red convertible. Go for it. You'll love it.","
I gave the 370Z NISMO a hard look before I bought my M235i; the 370Z's reputation for brake fade on the track gave me pause...","That's a good point. ""They"" say that good brakes and suspension is worth at least 50 HP on the track.","From the December 2017 issue of Car and Driver:

2009 Nissan NISMO 370Z
During our fourth running of Lightning Lap, a 2009 Nissan NISMO 370Z ended up in the tire wall after suffering brake failure at 130 mph. We dug into why it happened and weren’t comforted by our findings: Nissan spec’d the NISMO’s brake pads for their low-noise and low-dust characteristics and not for track use. Nissan introduced optional high-performance pads for the Z within months of our crash. We tested those pads and discovered that, while they could endure 12 or so more stops from 100 mph than the stock pads, the brakes still failed after only 24 stops. The brakes on a Porsche 911 or Corvette of the era could survive 45-plus stops with minimal fade. Thinking that the brake fluid had boiled on our Z, we switched to a higher-temp fluid and pushed the point of failure to 35 stops. We surmised that in designing the Z, Nissan didn’t provide enough airflow to cool the brakes. We suggested upgrading the pads and fluid and adding brake-cooling ducts for trackbound Zs.","Hi guys/gals, I hope you are well. I need a real-world trade in value of a 370z, info below:

Thanks ","Well, I did indeed trade in my 2005 Z today, in exchange for a 2016 Audi A5 Cabriolet.  They gave me $6500 for the Z and came down $1,000 on their original price of $38,500 on the Audi.  I think that was a fair deal.  Not fantastic, but good.  Where they held the advantage was that the Audi had all three packages I wanted, included neckwarmer, which is very hard to find.  Plus it had walnut inlays.  Not essential but a nice touch.  So it was a couple thousand more than similar ones without the Comfort package and the trim.

The only thing you might consider is an extended warranty. Ask them the price to just add a couple of years.
Not saying you should do that, but it would be good to get a number.

Since you have over two years of warranty left, you can judge how problematic the car is, over that amount of time. If it seems like too much, you can dump it in two years, and get something else.","
It's not all for the tires. It breaks down like this (actually closer to $5400 than to $7,000, I was remembering incorrectly when I wrote last night).

Audi Warranty: $2885. - Platinum plan. $85 deductible for warranty-covered services. Covers the car until 2026. Picks up where the current warranty leaves off, basically. Covers all mechanical parts of the car, plus 24 hour roadside assistance, towing up to $100, Rental car reimbursement for $35 a day. (Some of this duplicates my AAA coverage.). Can be transferred to a private party for $50 if I sell, or it can be cancelled at any time.

Audi Care: $1149. No deductible. Covers until July, 2020. Covers service work, oil changes and such, all scheduled maintenance from 15,000 to 45,000 miles.

Tire and Wheel: $1371. Covers until 2023. Covers cosmetic repair, blowouts, nails, glass, curb damage, TPMS.","

AudiCare looks marked up... The price to add AudiCare to a new car is only $869.

Extended warranty: Until 2026? It's an 8 year warranty from now, on an already 2-yr-old car? That just seems unlikely. What is the upper mileage limitation?

Qbrozen, want to thank you for this comment. Gave me the confidence to ask for the $1,000 reduction and they gave it to me with virtually no back-and-forth. Done at $37,500, just like you said. Decent price for my trade, so happy deal all around.","

36,"Since my automotive formative years were spent in school, this is right up my alley.

$2,500 is tough, though not as tough as it was five years ago. Any chance you can scrounge up a little more money? I'm asking because the used-car market is weak for newer cars. Everyone is buying crossovers and the like, and off-lease sedans are going begging. The low prices move down the chain but they haven't yet had much impact on the sub-$5k market. $6k will buy you one heck of a car that you could drive for ten years, if you pick it right. A $2 car will mostly be a grenade with the pin half out.

You should look for certain makes and models, but at $2-3k you really need to keep an open mind. It's more about the owner a that price point than about the make and model. Location is going to be important. If you're in an area where rust is an issue, older Mazdas might not be much fun. Around here (MI) they rust pretty badly. Hondas are better, Toyotas better still. Problem is, Hondas are popular anywhere and rarely a good deal in any price range. Toyota has fallen from favor somewhat, esp. their cars. A silver or beige Corolla LE with hubcaps isn't going to set anyone's heart aflutter, but if you can find a miley one that's been taken care of, go for it.
Nobody is going to cut you a deal on a 4Runner.

Your Volvo question indicates that you're not really plugged into car culture.
The fact you asked indicates that you're willing to learn. Spend some quality time reading around Edmunds, esp. this forum and maybe some model-specific ones, and you can learn a lot.
And I agree, no Volvos. No Audis. No VWs unless you're handy and then stick to the 2.0 engine and stay away from turbo anything. Manual transmissions are good, but not the Corolla/Matrix/Vibe/Scion tC 5speeds. Somebody was gonna find a way to screw up the stick.
No leather. Those always bring extra in low-end cars. In fact, if you can hold off until mid-June or later; now is THE time for people to buy low-end cars with their tax return money. It's even called 'Tax Season"" and it's an expensive time to buy.

Most 4sp autos are unkillable, esp. Japanese, also GM, but not all Fords and not most Chryslers.
Ford Focus 2007 and younger can be a good deal. By now, most of them are rats.

Look for a clean interior. 150k + miles wouldn't scare me if I can take a good look at the car, but then I kinda know what I'm doing. Get a pen light and start looking under oil filler caps. A few dozen cars later, you'll be able to tell who's had their oil changed and who hasn't. Four-speed automatics are your friend, esp. with the Japanese and with GM. Usually unbreakable. Chevy Impalas, Buick LeSabres, any kind of a GM old-persons car (Ja I know there may not be another kind), if it's clean and garaged, those often have conservative owners.
Dealer maintained, that sort of thing. You see 3.5 l V6 North of 300k miles sometimes.
I'm deep in GM country so (i) there are plenty of those around and (ii) they are sought after.
If you can find some in your neck of the woods and they're not appreciated, that's your gold.

The '07 and earlier Ford Taurus is not a bad choice. For a cheap car, get the 3.0 Vulcan over the 3.0 DOHC Duratec. There are LOTS of Tauruses out there, and many have been neglected and abused. It's that kind of a car, and they're getting old. I would not hesitate to buy a good example, but good luck finding one.

There's nothing wrong with the aforementioned Saturns or Cobalts, but choose carefully. Both represent good value, but along with Fiestas and Rios and the like, they were often maltreated by indifferent owners. I want a clean interior not because I'm too lazy to vacuum, but because it's usually a sign of proper maintenance.

NO CVTs. NO Chrysler 2.7 V6 -- the 3.5s are good, and the old 'LH' cars can be excellent deals.
NO 5spd automatic Accords and related Hondas.
NO early direct-injection engines -- though that's not likely to happen at the low end.

Trucks, SUVs, Crossovers are going to be $$$. Cars are where it's at for cheap transportation.
Korean cars can offer great value but I know almost nothing about them, sorry.
Ford Crown Vics/Mercury Marquis can be good, if you can deal with the fuel consumption.
Where I live, he Pontiac Vibe is known to be a Toyota clone and prices reflect it. If you find a cheap (automatic) one, go for it.

Find yourself a good independent mechanic. Any used car you buy will need to be inspected unless you're feeling really lucky.

Best of luck to you,

2004 Nissan 350Z Roadster
Red
Black leather interior
6spd Manual
73k Miles

Two owners, lots of recent maintenance: new clutch, new soft top, recent brakes etc. Not modified in any way except for an upgraded stereo.

What do you think this bad boy is worth?","Mine was a coupe, but good memory. I believe the leather makes it a Touring.

Condition means everything at this point. Needing a new top and clutch with those miles would lead me to believe it has not had the most pampered life. Let's call it $6k trade tops. So maybe $8500 PP? What do they want for it?","
My understanding is the clutch and top were replaced as a preventative matter since the car had not been driven much by the current owner since 2015 (illness etc.). Also, apparently the clutch life on these cars wasn't great from what I've read. It looks pretty well as pampered as I've seen a 350Z.

....$8600.","Q is right on the money there!

That is true, some cars are inherently hard on clutches--take the Boxster for instance. 80K miles and you are definitely done.

Having said that, I've never heard of a ""preventative"" clutch repair--it's not a cheap job, so probably the clutch was chattering or perhaps sticking. (pressure plate).

If a top looks shabby, it's hard to sell a convertible like that.","It feels like a reasonable price to me, so I wanted to double check. And it seems like maybe a better choice for a while both price and reliability wise.",How do you fit in it? They are a bit snug for some drivers.,"they certainly are being reasonable. I would have guessed $9995. If you can get it for $8k, I'd feel better about it.","
Fine - I'm not a big guy - 5'11 and 160 lbs.","I just fit in the coupe, but HAD to have the power seat. The little bit of front leg tilt made all the difference for me. I believe the vert has less seat travel, so it would be a no-go for me (I don't like verts, anyway).","I will most likely be trading in my 2005 Touring Roadster tomorrow. Same colors as above, half the mileage, AT, original top (looks good).

No problem fitting in it. Very comfortable driver's seat. Passenger's seat, according to my husband, not as comfortable, but since I was always the driver, that wasn't a big concern to me. It was nearly always driven as a one-person car, anyway.

I never measured it, but both the driver's seat and the passenger's seat have quite a bit of seat travel. I know because every so often I move them both all the way forward to get into the bins in back, and then all the way back to clean the floor mats.","biancar said:

Thanks for the input!  Any complaints?  I’m seriously considering it. "
37,"Thanks. I wasn't expecting much - ""inherited"" it from my parents, so anything is a plus.","Q,

In comparing two vehicles (same model/year/condition) but with different mileage, what rule of thumb factor or $cents per mile do you use to evaluate the true price of a low mileage car? For example you have A with 40k miles and B with 15k?
I know its not exact science, but just a rough estimate helps, specially for common high production cars like late model bmw 3 and audi A4 series.","depends on the brand and the value. When talking about a $30k used BMW, it is typically about $100 per 1k miles. A $15k used mazda is about $75/1k. The range is usually $50 up to $150, depending. Of course, as you get into really cheap cars, that has far less of an impact.","Thanks Q --good info.

Sometimes the inverse of low impact on cheap cars is also true--that some cars of high value suffer an unusually high impact.

On a Ferrari, for instance, the depreciation for mileage is massive. A Ferrari with say 60,000 miles on it is basically unsaleable at any tolerable price.

This would also be true, to a less drastic extent however, for most exotic, highly complex luxury cars, especially if they are out of warranty.",I believe Galves used to have something like a $250/1k penalty on even semi-exotics like the R8 or 750iL. I'm not sure they even bothered tracking Ferraris and Lambos.,Appreciate the information. Some dealers are just overly optimistic of their pricing of low mileage examples. This helps as a good basis to negotiate them down to reasonable terms. Btw I am looking at 2013-14 328's/A4's -sadly no semi-exotics yet for me,"Have a feeling my 2015 VW Golf SE is now worth somewhere in the $13.5K range or lower due to the recent accident. It looks good, really good, but bet a seasoned used vehicle guy will be able to spot the repair. And once it hits the CarFax, I'm gonna take a ding in the how much it's worth department. Just hit 40K yesterday, so at this point, gonna keep it for the time being and do the diminished value stuff and hopefully get some of that lost $ back. Since I did nothing wrong here, I feel more strongly about going forward on the dv case as I'll need that extra cash when I do in fact get a newer vehicle.
Learned that an accident can happen anywhere, at any time no matter how careful one is. It's the other folks we need to watch out for and try to be as defensive as possible! Have been hearing some really bad things about Windstream Insurance company and how difficult they make the process of taking responsibility for their drivers mistakes. At least down here, their reputation sucks big time and just wish I had deep enough pockets to sue their assess!! The way they conduct business is disgusting and I plan to make a complaint with the state of Florida's attorney general. Can't hurt, that's for sure, and did that years ago with a shady exercise facility and I got my membership fee paid back because of their deceptive practices. Can't hurt to report them to the attorney general and the Better Business Bureau. Might do squat but I'm tired of being run over by these companies that think they have no civic responsibility and run a shady business. Someone needs to speak up about this insurance scam company and might as well be me. Got nothing to lose really!!

The Sandman","Not sure about FL, but usually, the state's Department of Insurance is the entity that has jurisdiction over insurance companies.

(On that note, Auto-Owners and their local agent are about to get a complaint due to the agent's incompetency and misrepresentations regarding a deceased relative's estate. I'm sure DOI won't do anything, but the agent has earned themselves the headache they'll have to deal with in responding to the complaint. I really can't stand it when someone doesn't know the answer to a question and just makes up a bunch of lies as a answer.)","Could I get a real world trade in expectation for a 2016 Subaru Forester XT Premium, white, 37,800 miles, excellent condition, no accidents, no ding or dents, extras are roof rack with rails, window tint, all weather floor mats, wheel locks, rear cargo cover, rear cargo mat and all dealer maintained? I received an offer for $20K but feel it's a little low. I plan on taking it to CarMax this weekend but wanted to see what you guys thought first. Oh, and I'm in New Mexico.","Come the end of the 2018 MY that Forester XT is going to be more desirable, I think, because they'll have stopped making them.","
I agree.","
That offer baffles me. This was as a trade?? They can buy them in the mid teens at auction with those miles.","
Trade in on one of there on the lot vehicles. Are you saying that trade in number is high? I got another offer at $19.5K.",XT is the turbo. Mid teens seems really low,"I think a 2016 XT would retail around $24K--$25K out here in California. For a 2.5 Premium, $19K would be retail.

Miles are a bit high, however. Some cars are more easily ""forgiven"" for higher miles than others.","Yes, mine is the turbo. I bought it in September of 2015, so it was an early 2016.","Judge for yourselves



Can't quite get it all on screen, but that net number is $16,150.

Here are some sales



Obviously some disparity there, but not where I'd ever give $20k for one on trade (if I were a dealer), unless I'm really raking it in on the sale side of the equation.","Well OK, if we took the optimum end of the range you posted (thanks!) and nicked him $1000 for mileage, then the offer of $19K was more than fair for all parties, seems to me.

Seems like white cars are bringing the best bids, for some odd reason.","Fair for all? If I'm the dealer, I think I'll just head to auction and look for one like that $17k white one. I don't know what to make of that $19,750 unit.
I mean, just average out those 5 alone and you get less than $16k, which is why I said mid teens. And those ALL have lower miles than the one we are attempting to price.","Thanks, I guess I'll see what CarMax offers me. I know the last time I took my car to CarMax to sell to them, they gave me about $1k less than I could have sold to a private party, that was a 2013 Honda Pilot AWD EX-L. I know CarMax has one on there site right now for a 2015 XT, not a 2016, for $24K with almost my same mileage. I've had my car for 31 months, your screen grap says avg odo is 20K, that's 7K per year, that doesn't seem realistic. At an avg 12K per year, I should have 31K miles, so yes I'm over the avg but not signaficant. I'll follow up later to let you know what CarMax would give me.

Close to what @Mr_Shiftright was initially thinking.,"Did the Manheim auction today in West Palm again, it was actually fun this time. Getting more used to how things work now but it sure was hot out there!!
My Golf finally went over the 40K mark yesterday. Getting some paperwork for my diminished value claim tonight which my kid is bringing home. Need to fill them out and see where this all leads. Figuring on keeping the Golf until it plays out and then see. Sat in a 2017 Mini Cooper Clubman at the auction and liked it, a lot! Nice materials and though I think the rear doors are a G-d holy mess, like the vehicle overall. But think I'd either lease one instead of a purchase because not sure I'm gonna love it after a couple of years. But I'd go for a Countryman also. Since I don't like to put money down, wondering if they could roll the down payment into a larger monthly nut. Hate putting cash down on a depreciating asset to be honest and with a lease, the commitment period is shorter. The reliability issue bothers me somewhat plus I've heard the older ones rode roughly but hoping this newest Countryman has gotten all the bugs out.

The Sandman","
Well, for one, that's just the average of what has been through auction recently. Second, though, it is only April. We're still talking 2-yr-old models here, not 3. You may have bought yours early, but that doesn't matter when comparing to others on the market.

I'd be really curious to know what Carmax says.","you can always roll everything into a lease and do a true sign and drive. Just end up paying interest on what you roll in.

when I shopped Mini last year, we actually went in to look at the Countryman. But were not impressed by it. Plus the MPG was mediocre, and expensive. But we looked at a normal 4 door HT, and really liked that. seemed nearly as roomy (and big enough if you don't regularly carry lots of people or huge amounts of cargo), quicker, better MPG, and a lot cheaper. So if I had gone that way, it would have been that model.","
I'll add on to this.

@stickguy is right - you can roll everything into the lease payment. We recommend paying just the first payment and registration costs when you sign the paperwork.

There are three 4-door models:

Hardtop - traditional hatch in the back
Clubman - this has the ""clamshell"" doors in the back
Countryman - this is the quasi-SUV

I've had the Clubman as a loaner the last few times I've taken the daughter's Countryman to the dealer - the new iteration is much more comfortable. Have not tested the new Countryman, but I suspect it too is softer than the one my daughter drives.

The only thing about MINIs is that they can get real expensive, real quick. Don't compare these to a Golf - they are sort of in-between the Golf and the BMW 3-series, price wise. The Countryman can easily get into the mid to upper 30's on price, and $30K isn't unheard of for the 4-door Hardtop or Clubman.","Hey everyone, a mod told me it might be a good idea to post this here, so here it goes.

I'm in the market for a brand used car but don't have a lot of dough to spend. In my price range (a measly $2500) I'm seeing quite a few '01-'02 Volvo S60's and S80's. They look quite nice for my price range, but everyone is telling me that they are expensive to maintain.

The cars I am looking at are in the 120k-180k mile range, and I'd really appreciate some advice going in to this purchase. Are these cars really that expensive to maintain? Should I go for something like a Honda or a Toyota instead? I don't plan on having this car for terribly long (should graduate in 2-3 years) but I would like to get a car that is reliable and economical.

Thanks!","Mazda. Cheaper than toy/onda but as reliable and inexpensive to keep running.

yes, volvo will cost you more in the long run. A FWD 2.5T or 2.4 are reliable, but consumables like suspension and brakes can be problematic and costly. ","$2,500 is a tough price range. consider a domestic (Chevy Cobalt or some such). tend to be cheaper to buy (or for same price, you get a lot fewer miles) and still reliable, and usually cheaper to maintain.

where are you located? That can make a difference. and how many miles per year will you put on, and how (all around town, or do you need to take longer trips in it)?","True. If you could find a 2.2 liter Saturn with low miles, that could last you.",Second Mazda.
38,That's a tough one. You may not want to dump it until you get reimbursed for the DV due to the wreck. But you also will get more for it if you dump it before the wreck shows on the Carfax.,"Any UCM earning their keep will see it has been repaired.

I agree, but if it's been repaired with a clean CF, I don't think it's as bad as repaired with ""moderate/severe damage reported"" on CF, if Florida grades the level of damage.","I agree, but if it's been repaired with a clean CF, I don't think it's as bad as repaired with ""moderate/severe damage reported"" on CF, if Florida grades the level of damage.

I'd partially agree. I think if we all agree DV on a moderate to severe repair is 20% of value, then we can probably agree that a clean carfax probably only changes that maybe 2.5 to 5% at best. So you take a 17.5% loss instead.","A quick update on a car I posted a while back. My friend had a 2008 Accord EX-L with Nav and around 123k on the clock. @qbrozen suggested a private sale and listing it at $6,995 which is what I did. He ended up selling it in 5 days for $6,300 which I thought was more than fair. The buyer was a younger guy who had only owned Accords and had totaled his last one and this was just what he was looking for. So a win all around, thanks q for the info!","@qbrozen Any data on what these go for? I've always liked them and in considering a ""fun"" second car these seem to fit the bill. I've looked around and this one definitely seems overpriced, especially considering 2 accidents on the CarFax. If i went this route I'd probably ""want"" a 2011 or later for the refreshed styling and I'd prefer an R-Design but given these never sold that great options are a bit limited and those end up being a little higher than what I'd want to spend on a fun car.

But the auction was interesting with folks walking all over the place, sticking their hands in to feel how cold the a/c was.

Yes, $55.5k for a new 2018 AWD Hybrid Advance. As I said earlier, I have no comps for a 2017 but I think what you are quoted sounds reasonable. You'd be saving $4k to get one a year older with fewer than 4k miles. I don't think that is bad. I'd prob pocket the $4k, personally, unless the 2018 has something the 2017 does not.

HOWEVER, also check on financing. A better rate on a new one may make it much closer and change my mind.","

The Sandman",I have no idea. You should shop it around after you get it back.,"With an issue like that, it seems like dealers will give a much better price if they are really motivated to move a unit off their lot, versus a “CarMax” type deal where you are asking for a check in exchange for your car without buying one of theirs. Sometimes they will really step up if they think the are going to make a sale. ","Will do that in a few weeks methinks. Just have to see how good the repair was done first.

Yes to Toyota defying logic.

However, both of those are CE models. Big difference. One CE at the block like that only hit $2100. Another with a manual trans ... $500.

Maybe, MAYBE, I'd be interested at around $33k. $34k would be the MOON just for the privelege of being the only owner.","OK, thanks.

You get invested and then little problems keep you invested, and you never know when to bail.

For instance, I bought an older pickup truck for a very decent price. I put SOME money into it but I had the discipline to draw the line---so the cracked right fog light will not be replaced, and the AC leak will not be fixed and the automatic door locks can be operated with a key and a finger, thank you very much. It's a truck and it runs great and does what a truck is supposed to do--haul stuff.

But if no new car deal has been made, then yeah, you can ask them to bump it up. But be careful here--in this latter case, they can just tag the $900 back onto a new car deal.

Once I get it back, will be curious what the Carfax shows and your take on it's post accident value. Still might want to trade out of it no matter how well they repair it but have to wait and see how well they do repair the damage. Was thinking that a total would be the best way out but obviously, they thought different. They did agree to put a new rear drivers side door in the repairs, a good thing my collision specialist tells me. He says they will make it perfect so have to wait and see.
I'm just concerned about what I can expect to get post repairs with a ding on the Carfax!

The Sandman","My personal rule of thumb is a 20% knock for a ding on carfax unless enough proof can be furnished to show me it was minor. Yours obviously is not minor. Beyond that, how much of the car gets repainted can make a difference. You'd be better off shopping it to a few places where they can judge it in person. Then compare that to the unmolested number I gave you.","still seems cheap, for having to straighten out the unibody, and put a new door on, plus the other damage and a lot of paint.

Agreed.

Wife smacked her Jetta up when we were first dating in college back in 2008. No frame damage, somehow, but everything from both front doors and forward had to be replaced. Original estimate was $9000 and the final bill was over $12,000. This was on a 2004 Jetta GL.

All this to say that $6500 sounds cheap. Are they using all OEM parts?","As far as I know, yes. Using a top notch collision place that did my mirror back in December and other work for us years ago. They said it'll come back ""perfect"" but we shall see as ""perfect"" can mean different things to different people!
Am staying optimistic here about it all and will wait till I get it home. If not happy, can always trade it for something newer, which the wife's convinced I plan on doing. But not so sure if I'll even do that. Event though I did like both the Buick Encore and Subaru Imprezza a whole lot, both not something I have to have honestly.

The Sandman","Personally, I'd feel like the Imprezza is a step down from the golf. But to be fair, I have not been in a newer Imprezza.","Q, trust me, they've done a great job with the new Imprezza. Good enough that if they can get me the color combo I want, would have no issue trading in the Golf for it. Was even impressed with how nice the Encore was. Interior was well laid out though have no clue why GM still uses the same boring interior lighting especially in the dash. The new infotainment configuration is so much better integrated than the previous one and even the cloth seats felt great. It's also 168"", same as the Golf and perfect for my garage situation. I'd be just fine with either of these vehicles.
Just hope they can fix the Golf correctly and then I'll get back to you about the new value on it. I'm sure the Carfax will have the accident report on it already. Even if not, if I do trade it, I'd be honest and tell them about the accident if they asked but am betting a good used car guy will be able to tell there was damage by a physical inspection.. But again, honesty is the best policy so I'd feel obligated to tell them the history. Have found that if one starts to lie, eventually it is found out where honesty from the get go would just be so much easier!

The Sandman",The new Subaru Impreza is a fine looking car and I bet one with a manual transmission and red or that cool new tropical blue color would make you proud to have it grace your New Mexico...I...I mean Florida driveway. ,"
To me perfect means ""mint"" condition.","Didn't take long for my old truck to drop off the dealer website, less than a week!","I test drove the lighter blue with ivory interior and do prefer either the white over ivory or dark blue over ivory. But the availability is extremely limited and the special 2 year free maintenance plan runs out end of the month. So, these two factors alone will keep me from buying one which is a shame as it's a very good vehicle. Gotta hand it to Subaru, the new Imprezza is real fun to drive and it did put that smile on my face like the Golf does!
Now, just need to try the Hyundai offerings just to be sure. One big item in their corner is the size, same as my Golf or maybe an inch longer so it fits the garage test easily.

The Sandman","Ahh, the Subie Impreza's officially off your list now, sandman? Too bad. ",I know people love their Subaru’s but I just can’t warm up to them. Obviously I’m in the minority.,"Well, since they've decided to fix my Golf, no more looking as have to drive it first and see if it's really fixed properly. If so, just gonna keep it until whenever. Since I hate being pushed to do anything, this is probably the best solution. The big elephant in the room is how will it effect the Carfax on my vehicle? I'm assuming the shop will get it right because they do excellent work. But come trade-in time, wonder what the ding will be...$1K, 2K or more? Just know telling what it'll be and that's what's bothering me the most. Hoping it's fixed correctly, drives perfectly straight and have no issues to deal with.

My point is that as a car ages, your ability to protect its value diminishes, or it just doesn't pay to protect its value anymore.

In terms of DV, a car reaches a point in its life where it is difficult to argue that DV is any longer a factor, nor is a CARFAX ding.

The reason DV has been so controversial is because it has so many variables, it is difficult to quantify.",Uh oh. Should I put on my CPA hat and speak of assets and liabilities?,Please. I'm out of bluffs.,"
I get that. But to me the arguments are all pretty darn weak against DV.

I suppose we need a law to clarify that the loss will be defined as the total loss at the time and date of the collision. That eliminates the ""what if you keep it 10 more years"" argument. Not sure why we need a law for this though, should be pretty straight-forward as why you would choose any other date to determine loss is beyond me.

I suppose we could enact a law that says DV only applies to vehicles less than 7 years or 100,000 miles old.

I suppose we could enact a law that says DV will be calculated using certain defined methodologies to determine value short of requiring a sale (or force the Insurance company to make the purchase thereby creating the sale at whatever DV they wish to use (doesn't effect the victim that way). Example. DV is 1,000 for my S4. OK , Mr. Insurance company, have it your way on the DV, since my Insurance company proclaimed the ""totalled"" value of my vehicle to be $48,000, please send me a check for $47,000 and the vehicle is yours!

The risk should be put on the negligent party, not on the owner/victim. Forcing Insurance companies to ""buy-back"" DV cars would be a great equalizer and honesty enforcer! Suddenly, I think you'll see low-ball bad-faith DV offers go out the window. Don't offer too little, the owner might just call your bluff!

We NEED THIS LAW enacted.

I've been on both sides of the coin as to what I wanted to do.

I had a '92 Honda that was bashed and I fought fiercely not to have it totaled and to have it repaired, and keep it. I felt it was worth more than book.

I had a '14 Audi that I fought to have totaled, or at least a fair DV paid out so that I could total/sell it myself after the repairs were made without going bankrupt.

My law would be a free-market approach to determining DV value. Sort of how Vegas figures odds on sports. Get too many bets going one direction, and the market has spoken, and the odds are changed. Why can't Insurance do this?","I'll take a pass on the new laws, and the resulting increase in auto insurance premiums.

I'd rather put the money into defensive driving classes. You get into a lot of accidents!","
Me???? No, I get a lot of tickets, but into very few accidents, and zero at-fault accidents.

The uninsured incidents were all not-at-fault and happened to my wife (but I handled the claims as I'm the Insurance expert in the family).

The under-insured DV incident did happen to me and that was over 3 years ago now. Happened in March of 2014. At-Fault driver in the Lexus was 1,000% at-fault and the Small Claims court judge agreed, awarding me ultimately 100% of the court costs, fees, 3rd party service processing charges, my rental car costs, my $1,000 deductible and $3,000 in DV damages.

So in my sample size of 1 the Courts have spoken. That small claims judge might as well have been the Supreme Court as far as I'm concerned. Anyone tries to deny a DV claim in the future will get sued with the quickness, as I'm confident in my 100% win rate, and why shouldn't I be given that win percentage?

Before that, the last not-at-fault accident I had must have been about 10 years ago, when a La Mesa PD officer on a Harley gouged my rear bumper on the A3. I'm pretty good at avoiding the bad drivers in CA; better than most I'd say. Still, you can't avoid them all.

So when it comes to collisions, LAW Enforcement 1, Andres 0, where the lower score is better. So I will not get off my high-horse when I speak about law enforcement doing more harm than good.","

I agree, but on 1st party claims I think there is some ""moral hazard"" that comes with one's own negligence. People might just ""try less hard"" to avoid an accident if they get DV for accidents that are their own fault.

On 3rd party claims it should absolutely be covered. I don't get the resistance, in that I'm sure the Insurance companies can figure out a way to throw a profitable number on it, and charge accordingly. 1st party DV coverage could be exceedingly expensive though, and therefore the cost will make it unlikely to be adopted as a rider on any policies; sort of like Earthquake insurance in CA.","
Maybe regulators are part of the problem. Insurance companies want to be able to charge a profitable amount (often a greedy profit), and if regulators have the power to not allow ultra high charges that could give an Insurance company incentive to not want to offer a certain type of coverage (such as Diminished Value).

Otherwise, as I said above, why not throws a $$$/number on it, and make it an optional rider.","DV coverage will be worth it for some cars but not for others. An extreme case would be, say, a Ferrari. If that type of car takes a $30,000 hit, you can just about sell it for parts.

""A regular body shop can't even work on it.""

Not sure about the word ""can't"" there. Some won't, some can't, but that won't stop them from trying and charging someone too much anyway. At least, that's my impression of auto body shops.","I really doubt they could, and I doubt any insurance company would let them. There are very few shops certified by Ferrari to do this type of work. Up my way, any badly hit Ferrari goes on a flatbed down to L.A.","No matter what, I still think the purpose of insurance is to be made whole again when all is said and done. And definitely should be first priority to the party that's determined to not be at fault. That's why I hope they total it and give me very good book value for it because it is/was in excellent condition. My vehicles usually are because I baby them, do the proper maintenance on time, keep them waxed and washed on a regular basis and keep them in a garage 100% of the time. To give it to me back with a compromised history isn't exactly fair because once I go to trade it, I won't get as much as I would of without any accident history. Don't penalize me twice here is all I'm sayin' as just having the accident was bad enough, anything else is just adding insult to injury!
So, we're at $5200 and climbing with a few new issues that call for the adjuster to return to the collision center to re-evaluate. And looking like that 21 day window has been thrown out in the garbage now and depending on where we go now, could be closer to the 6 week time frame. I am not a happy guy right now!!

The Sad Sandman","I would not get too worked up about the timing. You are in a rental, so just keep putting miles on their car.

The insurance co. gets out of DV by pointing to the contract language. Basically, they do make you whole, in that you get back a car that has been repaired to be like it was before the accident. Which is all they promised you. What it is worth, well, that depends on if you keep it, when and how you sell it, etc.","Knowing that some states now consider DV to be legitimate, seems that more states should get on board here. No matter how well it’s fixed, there’s a history there that was caused by someone else’s negligence, and that’s what I need and deserve compensation for. Someone else caused the issue and their insurance company should be forced to pay me for the DV because without that missing piece of the puzzle, I will never be whole here.
It might not work for me, but hoping that in the future, more states do get on board so others in my situation will be treated fairly!!!

The Sandman",More coverage = higher premiums,"seems like something insurance companies can add as an extra. Like new car replacement, or rental car coverage. Not standard, but if you want to pay extra for it, up to you.","

Theoreticallly higher premiums for those causing the relevant claims. Don't cause accidents, not much DV cost there.","

No, I understand not-at-fault collisions can be unavoidable. A lesson I learned and was reminded of the hard way with the S4.

Still, as long as you are not out there causing at-fault collisions, you should not need rental or DV coverage, the other guys insurance pays for it.

I have my own ""uninsured/underinsured coverages"" but there is a GAP for uninsured DV and uninsured Rental. I will vote for a law that says un/under insured coverages will pay for rental car and DV losses.

Apparently, this guys common sense was on hold or something because who floors their vehicle backing out of a parking space? Well, he did, and he knew he f'd up because he kept apologizing to me about how sorry he was.

The difference is, I, unlike many people, am willing to pay for my over-estimations in ability.

I don't mind taking on that risk. But in my small sample size of people that cause wrecks, they all seem like deadbeats that don't want to contribute to making you whole.","
I think in some states DV coverage might be an add-on option.","well, you can go ahead and sue the driver. The insurance company is obligated to repair your car to ""as it was"" condition (whatever the term they use to that). So from their standpoint, they fix it, you drive it, done.","

For me ""as it was"" condition is ""as it was"" value. Condition = value. I can't separate the two.

If you can, you'd be a judge finding in favor of Insurance.

If you are like me, you'll be a judge putting the hammer down on Insurance.","For me, ""as it was"" condition includes repairing the CarFax and making any paint work undetectable by a mil gauge.",Good luck getting CARFAX to change anything.,"My 2004 Grand Marquis had a false entry on the Carfax. It said it had a major accident in the first year of it's life. No way. Pop bought less than a year old with 10K miles and there certainly was no paint work when he bought it.

It didn't have a real accident until I got rear ended in it 12 years into it's life.","
Also undetectable to the average used car manager/inspector/appraiser. Good luck with that.

Why are repairs detectable? Well, the only logical answer is that the condition has not been returned to original. Close, but no cigar.","If paintwork is involved, it just can't be returned to factory condition. ","Another good example is diamonds. To the naked untrained eye, most diamonds look the same (at the same size and cut), but the colorless and flawless diamond is worth more.

It might take a specialist to tell the color rating and internal blemish rating apart from another, but that doesn't mean there is no difference in value.

My definition of diminished value would be if an expert can detect repairs. The market views previously repaired vehicles badly, hence the diminished value.

Insurance companies want you to believe something that looks the same from a mile away is ""returned to original"" condition.","The fact is that the moment your precious new or not-so-new car requires major maintenance by the dealer, a bodyshop, or anyone else, it'll never be the same. You can like it or not, but that's the way it is, particularly with today's vehicles that are designed for quick assembly, not maintainability.

Many are the times I've worked later on a vehicle that the dealer or bodyshop ""fixed,"" only to find missing fasteners, washers, or whatever.

It's a crapshoot. OMG, it's ""not fair.""

Duh","
That's why I choose reliable models. And independent shops that try not to lose fasteners or forget to put them on. Shops that care.

$32k and your soul","So, if they don't total it, I get back a vehicle with an accident on the Carfax. Doubt many would buy it so trading it in at the dealer might be the way to go. On the other hand, if they do fix it to be like new, just keep it for a few years and go from there. But that could be a big ""if""!

speaking of...

What's going on with the 100K mile Cayman S?","I""m not paying Q's wholesale price for a beater, is what's happening. So dealer and I are locked in a death spiral of greed vs. desire. I know the dealer stole it, and he thinks that Cayman Ss are worth $30K all neat and tidy and I'm telling him he's easily $5K-$7K off the mark. He's a FORD dealer--I'm an appraiser. Who you gonna believe?

Besides all that, it's my least favorite color combination. Besides all that, this car is a risky purchase even if it were cherry with 50K on it. You lose that IMS bearing, the car is totaled, finito, done, gone--Ace Wrecking, here we come.

Just seems like too many things stacked against this happening. I'm going to pow-wow with my Porsche guru tonight and sort through options and models.

My friend Steve remarked: ""Well I think a Cayman looks like a dog's breakfast"". Very helpful comments for my quest.

Thing is, this Porsche quest is going to be a $20-$22KK cash deal. That's the budget---I cannot screw this one up.","Adjuster coming on Tuesday to access the Golf. Hope I end up in a good place after they decide what to do. Fixing it could take up to 21 days I'm figuring, using my wife's Camry incident back in 1995 example. It was t-boned and after being in the shop for about 30 days, got it back only to have her refuse to drive it anymore, she found pieces of glass still. They gave it back after 21 days but the work was so bad, we refused to take it back. They fixed the issues but she was never comfortable going forward. Was traded shortly on a '95 Camry and am sure we lost on the deal due to the ""diminished value"" of her old unit. Back then though, no one used this term or even knew what it was.
Sure hope their adjuster knows his [non-permissible content removed] and will treat me fairly. And wonder what kind of appeal process is in order if I'm not happy with their decision? This whole thing is a real p i t a!!!

The Sandman","Depends how it unfolds. It's nearly impossible to get an insurance company to change its decision about totaling a car (or not totaling it), but it is possible to fight them about the settlement amount if they do total it.

I spent quite a bit of time at the local Volvo dealer today. Sat in an S60. I might be afraid to drive one, as I might like it too much. ","oh, I liked it. a lot. Always have. Just one of those cars that ""fits"" me right. Good size, comfy seats, somewhat ""fun"", quick and gets good MPG. maybe not the most exotic or high tech, but well rounded. A stroke for every folk!

If I realized in October that you could lease one for .8%/mo, I probably would have one now.","
that's a bit pricey. I wouldn't want to break $19k on it.","@stickguy As the ""former"" owner of a car just like the one you posted I have to say it's one of the best values out there. The one my ex will turn in this June will have 47 - 48k on it, the residual is about $22.5k and it's by far one of my favorite cars ever. The G37x is the only other car that I would put on par with this one, but mainly because of the engine. The S60 had plenty of power and drove so well, plus those seats.

I remain impressed with what Volvo is offering and has offered the last couple of years. Time will tell if that holds long term as @michaell pointed out some of the S90s we saw today were made in China.","Thanks so much. Yes, I might need your help once I find out what they plan to do with the Golf. Looks like it might be a lot to fix but once they take things apart, then we'll know for sure. I'd hate for them to total it and just give me $10K for it, as I think it's worth more than that. Again, since I have no clue, will wait and see what they propose to do.

I went to look at the Porsche Cayman S that was traded into a Ford dealer, and this turned out to be a very interesting excursion.

THE BAD

The car looks like crap. Two golf-ball dents, scraped bumpers, tired tires (usable), worn driver's seat, some dash buttons sticky, hood release button popped out, hole in rear bumper (drill?), car is filthy, cup holder broken off, Rolling Stone sticky fingers decal. Color: Black Miles: 90K

THE INTERESTING

Carfax shows one local owner, serviced regularly at the Porsche dealer.

THE UNEXPECTED

The car runs beautifully. I wrung it out and it pulls like a train, handles, brakes perfectly, no rattles, no leaks. I rode this car hard and--no problems noted. Just amazing how well it ran.


What the hell?


So....hmmmm.....make a REAL low-ball offer? Pass on it? Their price is ridiculous and I'm sure they aren't into it very much. I'm surprised they aren't wholesaling it (and well they might). The re-con on this car would be hefty and really, I don't think they'd ever get it to look spiffy without a major effect.

I wonder what such a thing can be worth? I was thinking about $12K if it flew through a PPI. You know, re-spray the bumpers, dent-pro for the dings, a little touch up, re-upholster one seat, massive detailing, go to the wreckers for all the little busted bits, some decent tires (the wheels are spotless, oddly enough). Retail is about $20K--$22K I think.

What a peculiar experience this was.",,"Who puts a roof rack on a Cayman?

BOO NYY",Roof racks are cool. That means you must buy it.,"Well sure... a filthy 11 year old Porsche with busted parts, worn tires and driven by a Redsox fan.

My impression is that selling a shabby Porsche is like selling a dog with mange. The only buyers for one in this condition are idiots like me and we are generally bottom-feeders.,"So what is it? An '07?

auction value for a decent one is $17k. So what do you think needs to go into it? $1k in paint? $800 in tires? $400 seat reskin? $500 in miscellaneous? Let's call it $3k. Seems like $12k may be a stretch. ","I would be interesting to find out what it was traded for. Edge Sport, Fiesta ST, Focus ST, Focus RS?","Let's see---I'd say to make it ""presentable"" we'd need bumper paint, one seat recovered, another seat dyed, new cup holder, unstick dash buttons, repair hood and trunk release, new tires, paintless dent repair X 2, buff out headlights, a thorough PPI---soooooooo, let's say $3500--$4000.

Zooo, if der auction is $17K and retail is $20K--$22, I""m too high at $12K. For $20K I could have a totally nicer car, rather than a MEH Cayman at $16K.

Could I make that $16K car look like the $20K car for $4K?----no way.

I can see that the math doesn't work at $12K.

Thanks again","As the former owner of a 15 SL, I wouldn't pay for a certified one. It doesn't change the battery warranty, and the cars are bulletproof otherwise. I believe the 16 SL would have the 30kwh battery, which is certainly worth more than the earlier cars, but $19k feels high for any used Leaf...we all know how they hold their value over time.","2,200 miles. Wow! Still, not sure it is worth 19K. Consider, that's $0.42 per mile in depreciation compared to the other unit, which seems pretty steep to me.","How about this Colorado?

If I were even considering paying $30k for a used, three year old Colorado, I’d expect it to have leather seats. And maybe the diesel. Considering you can buy a well equipped new full size P/U under $40k, that’s not a good value. ","stickguy said:

Could you give me a ballpark of a pre-accident value and a post accident value? Damage looks to be fairly minor - rear bumper cover, reverse sensors, and some trim on the hatch (chrome, not painted). Wouldn't be reported to Carfax yet, but could be in the future.",I really can't help with post-accident value. I usually deduct 10-20% personally for a carfax ding.,And what would we be talking as pre accident?,"
That doesn't sound like a strong DV case, as you've presented it. Two problems: 1) the total damage might not justify asking $6000 in DV with a 20% claim, (presuming a pre-accident value of around $30K) the point being that a new bumper skin and some trim did not constitute a $6000 loss in value, or perhaps not ANY loss in value; 2) the idea of a future possible appearance on CARFAX doesn't really carry any weight, because it hasn't even happened.

The best DV claims usually involved panel replacement, or a high dollar $$$ amount of damage, or welding, frame work, etc.

No harm in trying but I wouldn't be very optimistic on this one. I write about a dozen DV claims a year so I kinda know how the wind blows. But again, I don't know all the details.","
You and I are 100% on the same page and I've explained this to my friend. I told him that if the damage is as basic as it appears on the surface, he can ask but should not expect much if anything. Now, if it turns out the whole hatch needs to be replace, one or both of the rear quarter panels, or they somehow knocked the frame, its a different story.","Well you can tell him that that's what a professional appraiser thinks, but that he is certainly welcome to try.

In the UK, Chubb Insurance will now underwrite DV claims--kind of a ""first"" in the western world.

But in the U.S., resistance to DV is still pretty fierce. They will pay under some circumstances, but the hoops and barriers are formidable. It requires persistence and a strong case to get anywhere.

I feel that DV claims are totally legitimate, but only when the damage is significant. And there are other variables besides dollar amount of damage--the type of car that has been damaged certainly factors into it.

You smack into a Ferrari and do a fair amount of damage to it (not hard to rack that up), that Ferrari is damn near sale-proof with a CARFAX scar on it. A repainted Porsche? That's a hard sell, too.

This is also why I tell people to boost their insurance on property damage. A $100K limit isn't good enough anymore."," I am no expert and certainly not in insurance, but I would think the best course of action is to get it fixed first, and then shop around and get purchase quotes from dealers. Maybe with a total of three quotes that are similar and compare that to actual auction values that I can provide, then maybe there is a case. Shifty may know better on that.

right now, auction is 27,000. But that may change by the time the repair is done.","Mr_Shiftright said:

Could not agree more. Long ago, I raised mine to 500,000 due to the cost of cars these days and repairs.  I also have an additional million dollar umbrella policy. ","
Why unreal? Electric vehicles use the roads, too. The fuel taxes for infrastructure were created when all vehicles that used the roads used the same type of fuel, and, typically, those that use more fuel put more wear and tear on the roads (more axles, heavier, etc.). So, once the paradigm shifts, it makes sense for the tax structure to shift along with it.

Subaru finances through Chase. Chase doesn't permit swap-a-lease. My original deal WAS $352 sign and drive, taxes and fees rolled in, but then the negative equity from the prior car was rolled in. Oh well, I guess I'll just bite the bullet and take it on the chin.","
Taking it on the chin?

I would look at negative equity as just finally paying the piper.

Taking it on the chin is paying $550+ because you missed a yellow light by 1/2 second (no hazard), or failing to make a complete stop at a Stop Sign (again, no hazard; I've never, in all my years violated someone's right-of-way at a 4-way stop), this one will cost $310 due by 4/5/18 (long grace period thanks to hired lawyer; of course, if I would have paid the ticket back in May of last year it would have been $280).

Meanwhile I have to battle the East County Court as they are trying to break the law via the ""administrative/clerical error"" method by taking away my request for the County Seat. The vehicle code makes it clear it isn't a request for a right to be granted, but a DEMAND for the law to be followed. Read CA VC 40502(b). Case law supports this assertion.

Taking it on the chin will be the East Country court saying something silly like ""my case will be unharmed and due process will not be violated by this infraction on the part of the court."" We shall see if they do the right thing, or give me an uppercut to the chin; sending off a letter today re-asserting my request for the County Seat, which of course, was granted by the Officer.

Reason for the problem? Likely that the clerk overlooked the cross-out squiggly lines for the East County Court, and ignored the lines for the County Seat Court. It wasn't an option for the Court to choose either or!","I think a 2018 Ram 1500 Laramie 39/10k (I know, I'll have that dreaded 3 months with no warranty), for $41X per month (sign and drive) before my ~6,000 in negative equity isn't a bad deal.

No, a lease is not necessarily the answer. Probably the worst answer since you have to pay off that negative equity faster in a lease than in a longer loan.

I guess I do not understand but I think it goes back to the dealer is going to get as much as they can for any car on their lot. When I visit the large dealerships the cheapest cars they have are $10,000.00 and when I say where are the $5000.00 cars they laugh. They tell me that every car that comes in for $5000.00 or less is gone with in a day or two. The truth of the matter is the $5000.00 cars that come in are now $10,000.00 cars. I understand about staying in business but why have the book values changed so much between trade in value and retail value? For example a 2007 Highlander Limited has a 90% difference between trade in an retail? Something more is happening here and I believe it has to do with the thousands of used cars that I see in parking lots with no tags on them. I am going to guess whatever trick the dealers are pulling with this it is going to come crashing down some day.","I think that markup (trade vs. retail difference) is more of a fixed dollar amount, not a %. So a cheap car is going to have a much bigger % increase compared to a more expensive car.

Using the $3K bump that seems pretty standard, on a $3,000 trade, retail becomes $6K, so 100% increase. But on a $30K car, that retails for $33K, you are only looking at 10%.

traditionally on the low end, new car dealers are not the place to go. Even a lot of higher quality used lots don't play in that sandbox. Instead, you get little mom and pop or BHPH lots, and a lot of private sales. There are a lot of $5K cars out there. Just need to know where to look (and what to be looking for).

Tough price point though. I always recommend that if you can stretch a little, can get way more bang for the long term buck at 10K.","yeah, I feel $7500 is about the cutoff between hooptie and decent transportation.","seems fair.

He was looking at stuff in the 8-10K range, and mentioning 7-8 YO/90-100K Yotas, etc. I found him a loaner Jetta SE (2017 with about 8K miles) at his local VW dealer, that he ended up paying ~14.5K for. 2+ years warranty left, well equipped, etc. I thought it was a much better long term deal, since he wants to keep the car for a long time.","Hi folks, I haven't been here for a while...lots of changes, dealing with aging parents.

I agree with you and that the cheaper cars ($3000.00) get marked up 100% because the dealer wants to make $3000.00. I do not agree with it because just imagine if everyone conducted business that way. Grocery stores shoot for a gross margin and make way more on a tub of makeup than a loaf of bread but if the car dealers would own a grocery store they would price the $2 bread at $10.00 a loaf because hey we got to make it worth are time. I have been buying used 2005 and 2006 Honda CR-Vs for a while now. I have been averaging 7 cents a mile depreciation and another 7 cents a mile for maintenance. I have 3 of them right now. I take them up to 200,000 miles and then sell them and buy another. (I have 3 boys) This has been a pretty good deal because the 05/06 CR-Vs were the best Honda built. If someone else has a formula that is less than 14 cents a mile for depreciation and maintenance I would love to hear about it. I have all my maintenance done at a shop.","You can't compare groceries or any other high volume business. It doesn't take 4 hours of a salesman's time, significant real estate, or ""floor plan"" to keep and sell a loaf of bread.

BTW, there are other businesses out there that have even higher markup. You really think clothing stores and furniture stores are losing money during their ""50% off"" sales? A $30k used car may have 10% markup and a $3k car may have 100% markup, but a $30k piece of furniture and a $3k piece of furniture BOTH have 100% markup (if not more). ",Yes this is 100% true. Many retailers still make 50 points even selling “on sale” at deep discounts. It’s just the way it works. Many retailers mark up things knowing that they give out coupons like crazy too. Case in point wife wants some Kitchen Aid thing and it’s 79.99 at Amazon..... Bed Bath is 99.99 but they give out 20% off coupons like water so they have to protect their margin.,"The unfortunate thing is to make people think they are getting a ""deal.""  I see it all the time with plumbing fixtures.  They show a price that is list price (nobody pays list price) and show ""FAUCET DIRECT 40% off PRICE"" or my favorite, ""$65.00.  COMPARE AT $135.00.  You Save X%"". 

Many of these companies have pricing policies that say they can't advertise there product online for below a certain price.  The websites get around this by showing that price and say ""sign up for our email newsletter and receive a special price at checkout.""

How do you like your 2017 QX60?","
TBH it's a bit of a mixed bag. There's plenty to like. Seat comfort is excellent. There's plenty of cargo space for pretty much anything we buy (including a six & a half foot long box that effortlessly slid in). Power is basically as I want it; i.e. not overwhelming unless I punch it but no problem doing 80 at the end of an on-ramp. Engine is turning 2100 RPMs at 80MPH; 2400 at 90; it's a great cruiser. Adaptive cruise is cool. Sport mode is handy for when strong acceleration is desired. I do not mind the CVT really at all as the QX fakes 1-2-3 shifting under some conditions so it feels like a regular AT. HVAC controls work pretty seamlessly; I especially liked the ventilated seat in summer and am thoroughly enjoying the heated steering wheel.

But .. I've had a couple of (presumed) sensor glitches where the front collision avoidance just errors out and doesn't operate until I reboot the car (shut it off/on). While I love the surround-view camera it's a little goofy in that if I shift into reverse and I'm close to something in front it still beeps at me. Hello? I'm in gear to head the other direction. And the infotainment, specifically USB interface, is sorely inadequate. Many cars give you the hierarchical folder view that you might set up on a USB thumb drive, allowing you to group/sort your music however you want. But Infiniti does not honor that and instead does a single list of all folders containing music. And worse, you cannot sort the list and it isn't in a consumer-friendly order; i.e. alphabetical. All of those negatives are with the electronics and really should be fixable via firmware updates if Infiniti were so inclined. The main physical gripe is minor but the cargo floor has a slight slope to it; if you were to put a ball in it would roll towards the liftgate (and potentially fall out on it's own when the gate was opened). The USB ports don't seem to charge high-speed, at least with my phone.

Fuel economy is a little shy of what I expected but then the car is still young with just 6600 miles so far and the bulk of my driving is considered on the city cycle. And I will probably never engage Eco mode; I didn't buy a 295HP car to drive in Eco mode. Cornering/handling is on the soft side but is fine for day-to-day.","I don't see that one so it must not have been Manheim.

That is a very good point! This happens pretty often. A customer has a trade that the dealer simply doesn't want! He may have three already that have been sitting. It may be a bad color or something that just doesn't sell. Yet, they HAVE to take the trade in or lose the sale on the new car. Making things worse are they shoppers who ""know"" what their trade is worth! Kelly Blue Book doesn't buy cars! They simply print values which may or not reflect reality. We took in a lot of used cars that we just hoped didn't bomb at the auction!","
Penske dealerships have done a ""get Kelly Blue Book"" trade-in value promotions in the past. I have a feeling the ""books"" are favorable to dealerships on trade-ins.",Not really. Sometimes the numbers make sense other times not. It's always the MARKET that determines pricing which may or may not be in accordance with what the books say.,"That's right. Buyers set the market price, nobody else. Perhaps dealers or price guides can influence the buyer, but ultimately, the market bows to the buyer.","
Sellers are able to manipulate the price buyers are willing to pay by controlling the supply. Make something very limited and the supply is so low it drives the price up. I think the M2 and TTRS fall into this category.","I don't know about that, in actual fact. The theory of supply and demand sounds good but there are plenty of rare things that nobody wants. There may be short-term emotional buys that drive up prices but ""The Market"" looks at the long view and and takes in a vast number of sales points for consideration.

So the one or two sales of some ""rare"" car are no more the market than the weather outside your window is ""The Weather"" all over the globe.

With today's internet, it's very hard to ""control the supply"" of anything. I think breld proves that a number of times.",Well I dunno about that shifty.. seems like breld controls the demand pretty good,"The source of power for the buyer is not only yes, but also NO! So powerbuyer breld says ""no, I don't want your rare TTRS at that price"". If a few brelds in a row do that, the price is gonna drop.","
That's my selfish reason for being against the $15 minimum wage. I don't need McDonald's workers driving up the price of everything by saying ""yes"" to sellers all the time, including my Audi's (Inflation is a problem).","

Well, on something like the TTRS, if it is true a dealership only gets a certain allotment that is extremely limited, they might not be inclined to give you a deal on an ""ordered car."" You take the one on the lot, or, if you say no, another guy says yes the next day and now you have zero TTRS's to buy brand new.

A buyer has to take this into consideration. If I'm told No to my offer at a Honda dealership, I'm certain I can find that exact configuration somewhere.","The ""shortage"" is an artificial concept, though. There's only a ""shortage"" if there is desire out there. Buyers' tastes can change in the snap of the fingers. Buyers rule.","
I suppose that's what it boils down to. My position is they would sell more M2's and more TTRS's if they built them, they would come.

It might drive down the average transaction price down a bit, but they could sell a lot more in the US than they currently do.

I do know some status/badge buyers look at rarity as a good thing. They buy the $100K Porsche over the Audi for no other reason than less people can afford it than the lowly TTRS. Not saying everyone does so, but some do, especially the LA types.","Substitute ""Civic Type R"" for ""TTRS"" and @breld went through that exact scenario last year.

I think that has to do with the programming and sophistication of the AWD system. I'd suspect Toyota and Honda barely have AWD by definition. Subaru's is a good symmetrical 50/50 all the time system.
Audi's is in my biased opinion the best, often with a 60/40 Rear-bias split all the time system in the S models.

Admittedly, I don't have a lot of experience with AWD outside of Audi and VW. I have done several test drives of Subaru's, but that's about it. I do remember test driving a RAV 4 with and without during a hard rain (couldn't tell that much of a difference).

Did you compare the sport suspension of the A3 to the A4 around that time frame? My '06 A3 with the sport suspension was really hunkered down! Choosing the ""sport"" package was the best decision I ever made with a new car. Without it, I might not have become an enthusiast (although there's always coil-overs upgrades).","
No, I had driven an A3 when they first came out in 2005 or so, and it felt very nimble and sporty. Don't remember whether it had sport suspension. My A4 had the ""sport"" suspension. They were running an amazing lease deal on the A4, so the A3 wasn't a consideration at that point.","

$3k is also odd if both have 18k miles. $2500-$3k is the typical difference in model years in this pricerange, but that includes a year's worth of miles, too. In other words, $20k for a 2015 with 36k miles vs $17.5k for a 2014 with 48k miles, for example. 

If I had taken a blind guess on yours, I would have expected a $1k bump going up one model year but at the same miles. Oh well.

The 2016 Lux is his current leased vehicle - he'd like a trade value on it.

I've been in touch with @jpp5862 all afternoon - it's almost impossible to get a fair market value on the TDIs. One dealer offered 15% off sticker, but they didn't have a preferred color.",Still not following. So is the ask for the value of a non-TDI?,"qbrozen said:
Still not following. So is the ask for the value of a non-TDI?
Correct. ",About $29k for a 3.6 Lux.,"I will say that the trade in value has really dropped in the last few years on most vehicles. Here in Cincinnati there are about 5 family's that own most of the big dealerships. They will offer $3000.00 for your trade in and then put it on their lot for $8,000.00 and not even recondition it. Heck you are lucky if they clean it up. I got a really big laugh from the very first post on this thread from my old buddy isellhondas when he said why would we pay more for your trade then we can buy the same car at auction? There are many reasons. Can you test drive the car at auction and put it on your lift and inspect? and of course the big question do you want to sell your new Honda? Your question leads me to believe that you are really asking ""do we think you are stupid"" but then you offer a low ball price for my trade (way below any book price) and say the thing I have heard a million times "" well that is what it sells for at auction"" and then mark it up $5000.00 you must think I am the stupid one. I also notice here anyway that the dealers lots are busting at the seams with used cars and they are renting abandon warehouse parking lots to park more used cars. Whatever they are trying to accomplish must be working because you will be hard pressed to find a car over $4000.00 for sale by a private owner anymore. I guess there are too many scams for people to sell cars these days? The days of finding a good low mileage used car cheap is almost impossible because that 2004 corolla with 50,000 miles on it that the old lady traded in for $2500.00 is now a $9500.00 Cream Puff on the dealers lot.","Normal markup on most average used cars is $4k. But that is asking price. I can't say for sure, but I'd wager the average selling price works out to just north of $3k over. ","@just_focus:
I sympathize, and it was probably therapeutic to get all that off your chest.
Here are a few thoughts on the subject:

- The business with ""mark it up $5000"" is a bit much, but four thousand is normal. In 2016, I sold my 2014 Outback to the dealer I bought it from. Sure enough, they gave me $19 even and put it ont he lot for $22,995. My boss just traded a car in for $8,200 and sure enough, they're asking $12.
As qbrozen said, that's the asking price. If they can't ""make"" two thousand bucks per car, however you want to define their ""profit"", they will not survive.

- The really bad part about this is that working poor people have a hard time finding a serviceable $2,000 car anymore. The low end of the market got jacked up by the financial crisis. Plenty of good $2k cars around.. for $4k. This is in the process of getting fixed, as there are much more cars at the low end available now that a couple years ago and prices have started to normalize again.

-  You reference ""book price"" in your post but that means almost nothing in the low end of the market and is the source of a lot of confusion. Everybody puts in ""excellent""condition for the 2005 Camry. No such thing as an ""excellent"" car with 100k on it. In the $3,000 region, you have to go the other way and ask -- what are the odds I spend $3k on this car and get 30k miles out of it -- 10 cents/mile being a strong value for transportation, and a good number to shoot for. I'm seeing any number of cars on our local Craigslist -- some from dealers -- that meet this criterion.

- It is an unfortunate fact that many customers will roll in with a car on its last legs that they owe money on. Part of the the high asking prices on dealer lots are due to this fact -- sometimes you have to structure the deal in such a way that two or three grand in negative equity have to disappear to put a deal together. Many people are in that situation and don't even realize it. I'm not saying any of this is a good idea, but it's a reality. It's expensive to be poor.

Like most, I prefer buying from private owners. But there are two advantages to buying from a dealer: #1 they know what a car is actually worth, and #2 they buy 'em right.  Over the past few weeks, I've helped two colleagues buy used cars, and they both got them from the same used-car dealer... where the ASKING price was less than any comparable ""deal"" from private owners advertising on Craigs. A third car just sold after three days on the lot that I was thinking of getting myself... if you know what you're doing, there are deals to be had.

Tax season is upon us, so it'll get crazy again for a few months, but overall the used-car market appears to be on the mend.","Also... when the dealer goes to the auction, they can buy whatever vehicle they want. If it's a make/model they don't want, they just pass it up.

But, if you are trading, they have to take your car. If it's not something they would have purchased, otherwise, they are not going to offer you the full auction price. If it's something they would rather not have at all, then they have to send it to auction, pay transport and auction fees, etc, etc.","Wife was in a minor accident the other day.

You'd be looking at about $10k-10.5k retail replacement cost."
56,I'm going to assume west coast and AWD. Puts you at roughly $16.5k-$17k trade.,It’s actually a FWD. How does that affect its value?,not too bad. $500 less.,"My residual is at $16.9k, so it does not look like I have much equity...","
It might not go to arbitration. I'm betting most Insurance companies will negotiate up to $1,000 dollars to avoid additional hassles. I got Mercury to cough-up an extra $200 on a Civic by just showing them some listings/advertisements for similar cars, and asking for a little bit more (the original offer was actually fair, not low-ball, Surprisingly!) They offered $200 more to make me go away and I took it the second they offered it; not much hassle at all.","
Funny you caught that. Car went from mint condition to 2 prior accidents in a hurry! Fair condition at best from an optimistic viewpoint.","You never know with insurance companies---they are totally squirrelly and unpredictable. In the case of demanding $1000 more, they have the right to automatically kick it into arbitration. They don't have to negotiate with you at all. So unless you are really being low-balled, and there is considerable money on the table, you could outsmart yourself and end up spending $750 bucks to (maybe) make $1000--and spending a lot of your time to boot. You have to make a calculated type of decision after doing your homework.","
I disagree! LOL. Having our first BIG rain of the year today (no rain in Fall/Winter 2017 either!)

Was in the Kia this morning, and I quickly discovered tire spin when trying to accelerate while turning the front wheels. Tires are pretty good in the rain and have plenty of tread too. Didn't alter the car's trajectory, just wasted some fuel towards tire spin rather than velocity.

I have a feeling any 2-wheel drive car would struggle in wet slippery conditions with my driving style.","
I haven't looked at a ton of ""totaled"" claims, but I have seen a few thanks to some friends and family members involved in them. Seems to me, Insurance companies don't mess around as much when a car is totaled. They seem to offer a fair value, or even more than fair in order to settle quickly and avoid pissed off clients.

Even in my diminished value claim, I had no problems with their valuation of the S4, only their valuation of my previously wrecked S4 was the issue.

Once (and that's a big ""once"") fault and liability is established/accepted/admitted, it seems insurance companies are a bit easier to deal with, at least in my small sample size.","
The day Eyesight package is ""essential"" is the day I'm going blind.","AWD is all about traction, but you pay for it in terms of cost and weight.","
You got to pay to play! Even with worn out Cup 2 tires yesterday evening in a lighter/medium rain, my TTS was a hoot to drive. Fast acceleration was effortless, but with the worn out dry-traction slanted tires, I suddenly found the speed limits and general flow of traffic to be semi-appropriate.","
Also, accelerating during a turn falls in the ""handling"" category for me, even though it is due to AWD's superior traction, for me that is equivalent to superior handling.","Maybe not. You can't rotate the car very easy with throttle on a dry track with AWD, ---but on the other hand, AWD does favor the less experienced driver to a point.

Generally speaking, RWD dominates all forms of racing except rally.","
Yes, but racing is usually done in good weather. Also, racing usually occurs on perfectly paved tarmac.
The real-world of government built roads is closer to rally than track","True enough. I would say don't buy an AWD car unless you really really need one. You'll spend more in fuel and if something breaks, it's pricey to repair.","I think the best answer here is to own one of each. FWD, RWD and AWD. Problem solved.",AWD is a nice addition to an otherwise FWD car.,"I wonder what the market says about AWD in Phoenix or Florida? Maybe Q has a word on that.

Another interesting wrinkle on AWD, which isn't really related to value, is that it inspires over-confidence in some drivers, to their detriment.

AWD vs. Laws of Physics---guess who wins?","Having grown up driving RWD, I have never felt totally comfortable with FWD. AWD seems to be more neutral and the mileage penalty doesn't seem to be too bad.","About 1-2 mpg in most cases and a few hundred pounds of weight, which, I have to say, you can feel if you drive the two cars, one RWD, one AWD---like a Porsche, for instance.","From my (admittedly limited) experience with that, I think the difference is more pronounced when adding drive to the front wheels in a RWD car, than it is adding mostly passive AWD to a FWD car. I honestly don't think I would notice a difference driving a FWD RDX instead of the AWD version the vast majority of the time. On a 3 series BMW, that I noticed a difference.","When I test drove an RDX, I felt it. I thought I was driving an AWD model. The salesperson thought so, too. But after a couple of miles, I said either it doesn't work or it is a FWD model. After we got back, he checked and found out it was FWD.

My order of preference is RWD, AWD, FWD.","In southeast US:

2015 328i = $18.8k
2015 328xi = $19.6k

A Q40, however, only sees a $150 difference for having AWD. Odd.","It feels like a FWD, sure. The AWD doesn’t change it really though.","The small price difference with the SUVs kinda makes sense, since SUVs as a rule are marketed as ""safer"", and thus an AWD/SUV is safer still, right? RIGHT?

Unsubstantiated claims, but they seem to have an effect. You can't deny buyers' preferences for SUVs and trucks right now.

With a ""driver's car"", I suspect the AWD prejudice in warmer climates would be more pronounced.",I would think it also depends on how advanced the AWD system is too. In the Fusion Sport I drove the AWD setup it is not as advanced as say Acura's SH-AWD or quattro. The driving experiences were vastly different as well.,"I experience much better wet weather traction with AWD than with FWD. Very little concern about having to baby the throttle to avoid breaking traction (or engaging TCS). Heck, even in dry weather with the all-season tires most cars get it's way to easy to break traction when pulling away from a stop with anything more than moderate pedal pressure. AWD solves that.

I live in the snow belt and while I can usually avoid driving under severe conditions, sloppy roads are fairly common in winter. Local & state DsOT don't plow/salt/sand as much as they used to since they're always under such intense budget pressure. Coming back from my in-laws after visiting for Christmas involved driving 30-40 MPH for over 20 miles on an interstate that was getting slammed with lake effect snow. Maneuvering with AWD offered a lot more confidence that FWD.

The added cost up front and 1 MPG penalty are easily prices worth paying. The situation might be different if I didn't live where I do.","Asked for trade-in value few days ago, but provided the wrong vehicle Year!  Here is the request again with the correct info.

Hopefully Q will get a chance to respond with real numbers. Seat of the pants, from a Subaru guy, is that it is a solid buy. That's ~25% off MSRP for 13,000 miles. The best you're likely to do on a new vehicle might be as low as $32,200, so you're looking at a savings per mile of about 40 cents (e.g., $5,200 difference / 13,000 miles = $0.40/mile). You won't be driving that car for anything near that going forward, so you're getting a pretty solid discount on those miles.

If your are comparing it to leasing a new one.... then, it will be hard to beat the 39 or 42 month lease program that Subaru has now, on the 2018 Forester. Once you factor trading in at wholesale when you get ready to sell, the lease will be cheaper overall (most likely).

Not to mention, better cash flow with the lower payment","Agreed; if you don't plan to keep it more than the period of the lease, then it probably won't work out in your favor on the purchase. However, that is a very strong purchase price, so if you sell it private party down the road, and Subaru keeps its strong resale as it has over the past decade or so, then it might be a near thing.","
Well it gives you a 5-year depreciation, so just use the 2nd or 3rd year figures.

Or, you could price out the exact equivalent 2018 model--that is, what you are likely to pay (not MSRP), and then compare that to the $27K you are paying for a one-year older model. That's probably the depreciation hit the 2018 will take.",What would be a good price for this?,"

It is tolerable with the manual, but $7500 is just crazy talk, IMHO. Almost any other $7500 car would be better. To me, that's a $4500 car, at best, with a manual. And, funny enough, $4500 is auction value.","Sorry, but I had a Versa sedan of that generation with the CVT as a rental, and thought it was decent.

Private sale will definitely give you the most $$ and the most hassle.
In rust-free LA, it'll be worth a pretty penny.
The stick is no problem in a big market like that -- like you found out, they're hard to find for the few folks who want them... at least you have a large pool of potential buyers.

And I understand LA is different, but dude: HOW MANY MILES????
That might impact the price a bit, no?
While you're at it: color? How are the tires? General condition? Smoker's car? Any body work? That sort of thing.Of course, ""two large dogs"" sort of paints a picture about the interior...

Regarding the 4Runner: I can't speak to value specifically, but (i) if I were buying a recent Toyota anything, I'd just go new and have better value + peace of mind.
And (ii) it'll be a cold day in hell before I pay over $30k for a used mass-market vehicle.

HNY -Mathias","Apologize for the vagueries Mathias- I'll run down the list. 
• 68K miles
• Magnetic Gray Metallic
• Tires are stock-size KO2s with 10K miles on them- they still have all their whiskers. 
• A few light scratches on the bodywork, what they call ""Arizona pinstriping"" (driving on narrow desert roads through creosote and chaparral). I plan on getting the truck detailed to get rid of them.
• A few insurance claims, including getting struck by a forklift while parked at work, that resulted in bodywork fixes. All restored but I'm sure they show up on a Carfax. 
• No smoking. 
• Pet hammock installed when driving with dogs, so minimal furry wear-and-tear. 
• In general, a pretty well kept truck. Serviced every 5K at Toyota dealers, so records are all there. No modifications other than a soft-top camper that I plan on selling separately. 

Thanks again for your input. Yeah, it seems pretty silly that they'd list a 2014 and 2018 truck within $5K of each other, these damn things hold their value too well. I'm planning to limit myself to no more than $10K of financing after selling/trading the Taco. ","Tacos do well in CA. A clean automatic like yours would be $21.5k-$22k. How we treat the handshaker and bad carfax is the mystery. You won't like this, but I'm going to say $17k, give or take. I have heard of some dealers overlooking bad carfaxes, so you never know. But be prepared for those low numbers.

PP sale? Given the special nature, you'd want to advertise it far and wide and talk up the manual trans. If there are Taco boards, that is a good starting point. I'd probably start her at $23,995 and see what happens.

I would need more info on the 4runner to be of any help there.","Why don't you post the VIN and we'll see what the CARFAX actually looks like (we won't post the actual report).

I agree with Mathias--in such a huge market like LA, I think the buyer pool for a manual transmission is large enough so you don't have to offer a big (if any) discount. As for the CARFAX, I've found that it often depends on ""how it reads"". Sometimes the language describing the accident is benign, sometimes ominous.

For instance, it could say ""incident reported"", which sounds pretty harmless. Or it could say ""front impact, airbags deployed"" and in that case, the seller is really up against it.","Example of Tacoma’s insane resale?

The US Bank lease on our 2017 has a residual of 82% of MSRP, after 3 yrs, 36K miles. (stick shifts get higher residuals than automatics on Tacos)","Here's the VIN for Phoebe (the Tacoma):

You'd be paying quite the premium for the low miles.

As stick said, there are newer choices for that money. If you are a diehard toyo guy, a new 2018 Highlander v6 AWD LE plus can be had for $36k. BUT, it sounds like you offroad, which those softroaders aren't good for. ","kyfdx said:

I'm trying to help a buddy pick up a lease on a Tacoma or Colorado. He's fine with a stick and wants a payment no more than $250 so just need to locate a dealer that will do a US Bank lease and hope the figures are similar.","
CARFAX is clean. Looks good.","Yes, I am one of those weirdos who uses the truck as intended. The Tacoma, FJ, and T4R are incredibly capable vehicles (if a bit old-tech with solid rear axles and BOF). Speaking with my wife, we think we'd like to have the ability to take the family in one car (we're planning 2-3 kiddos plus the dogs).

This either means minivan or wagon (which I wouldn't mind, actually). I'd much rather go full Dad-mode and get a minivan than an SUV just to prove I'm still ""cool"". But this would mean trading in her car (a clapped-out 2008 Prius with a slowly dying hybrid battery) for a minivan and having two large cars if we wanted to keep adventuring.

I figure the 4Runner can haul kids and dogs, go camping, and work well in the snow- all in one vehicle. Cheri can drive her Prius until the wheels fall off (not much trade-in value so might as well) and then replace with a small economic car down the road.

Our beloved (RIP) Pathfinder had a number of dents underneath and other battle scars.,"Michael I think you mean Hungry Valley, near Gorman? No I have not visited there much except for a few trips into Frazier Park. The photos are as follows:
• Coming down Berdoo Canyon from Joshua Tree
• Cold morning in Mammoth. The snow was amazing that day- a new foot of cold smoke. 
• Christmas weekend, again in JTNP. Old Dale mining district. 
• some old mining cabins in Mojave National Preserve... I think in the New York Mountains. 
• Just above Convict Lake in the Sierras. Low snow that winter. 
• Reward Mine, just outside of Independence, CA. Yes the mine is large enough to drive into for over half a mile!
• Leaving Mammoth again. Lots of heavy, wet snow they call ""Sierra Cement"". Highway 395 towards home had snow clear down to Lone Pine that night- drivers kept their chains on for over a hundred miles trying to get home. This truck on KO2's never batted an eye. KO2's are phenomenal off-road and snow tires! Haven't tried them in much mud though. ","
Yep, I meant Hungry Valley. See, that alone tells you how long it's been!

Great story about that one. In that picture the engine was turned off for about 5 minutes while we explored. Well, the five year old battery... Gave up. Truck wouldn't start, just clicking from the solenoid. How's that for a Triple-A call? 

We let the truck cool down for a bit (outside was 100º+, inside the mine was a cool 65º). We almost hiked to the entrance to call for a jump, and I tried the starter one last time and it cranked over!

Small enough that we toss it in the wife's trunk for storage as her car has the 5+ year old battery & mine is under a year.

My sale price was somewhere around $23,5 plus an over-allowance of $500-$1000 on the trade.

This was back in October/November 2015.","so basically $6-7K in 2 years. Or $240-$280 per month. So, really, no ouch involved. Probably about what you would have paid on a lease per month (not sure if a 2 year lease would be more or less). In any case, you drove a nice brand new car for modest money.

Cars depreciate heavily the first couple years. And you gotta pay to play! But does not sound like you really paid too much. If I could flip out of my Elantra in 2 years for $250/month, I would consider it to be pretty good, because that is about what a lease would have been.","Agreed - my response was more just a visceral ""I was hoping for more"" response.

I did not pay too much - I got it when dealers had a pool of money from VW to help them through dieselgate and they were more than happy to move a car.","getting a good deal was why I am not worried about getting out of my Elantra at any point. it is a 2018, I put on low miles and keep them nice, and I only paid less than $19K for it.",Among one of many things I find leasing attractive for is not having to worry about dealing with a trade in or following the depreciation curve.

Expensive car to repair, too.","
Yes - it is, and that we know. This dealer thinks they have g-d's gift to cars in this truck and aren't really willing to budge nor are they willing to do any of the services needed.

Just some pesky plastic water pipes under the intake manifold seems to be the only weak spot. I drove one and wanted to love it, but there were 2 problems for me: I did not find the seat comfy enough and it scared the bejeesus out of me. Making 2.5 tons go that fast that quick is just asking for trouble. I did not feel confident the chassis and brakes would stand up to the challenge of me behind the wheel.

I honestly don't know how to treat something like this. Kinda have to see it and touch it and decide if I could find a buyer (if I were a dealer). I'm gonna take a WAG at $20k. That would leave me a couple grand to either return to stock or take a hit on selling it if need be.

I have no realistic numbers for this. It is worth what someone is willing to pay, frankly. If I try to use historic auction values, it is worth nothing because I try to deduct for the extra miles and wind up with less than zero. (example: 63k miles = $8500; deduct $75 per extra 1k miles = -$2525) Even if I'm flexible and deduct $50/1k, the result is $1150, and that isn't even taking the rust into consideration nor the costs of getting it TO auction.

Stock ones were slightly sun bleached. Seats have always been covered with neoprene covers, they are mint underneath. I just replaced the last set as they were a bit sun bleached.
I honestly don't know how to treat something like this. Kinda have to see it and touch it and decide if I could find a buyer (if I were a dealer). I'm gonna take a WAG at $20k. That would leave me a couple grand to either return to stock or take a hit on selling it if need be.",@qbrozen - Thanks so much!  You hit the nail right on the head as always!

Take it. And yes, tax and license is added on to that.

I hate that it's 40 min to get there and I don't have a tame mechanic within range... a bread-and-butter car like that I can probably evaluate myself -- if you can see into the cylinder head and look at the valves and timing chain, you know whether it's been maintained.

Some day I'm gonna mess up and then I'll wish I had some backup...

FWIW, carfax and autocheck are valuable resources. Two problems: Wrong information -- like wrong mileage entered leading to TMU -- this you have to know about before you buy, even if it's obviously bogus... and missing information, which is quite common. I consider it necessary but not sufficient.","If they let you take it out by yourself, just drive the snot out of it and see if anything breaks, leaks, makes noise or refuses to work.

It wasn't black I might think about buying it myself.
It's been for sale on craigs for $4,800 with no takers in a month.
I'm thinking low 4's or $4,500 OTD -- tax is six percent -- ought to do it.

The car looks clean with a flashlight, but I haven't driven it or been inside it.

It handily meets what I call the 'Stetson Criterion' after a friend who came up with it: Can you expect to run it for 10 cents/mile in cost + repairs + maintenance? By that math, it needs to run another 40-50k without major work. Sounds very doable.

Candidate #2 is more of an oddball, out of curiousity:
2004 Acura RL, dark gray, 120k, sunroof etc. etc. Nice shape and no rust. I don't know about upkeep on these. Asking $3,800.

You will likely have to spend a lot of time going back and forth trying to get the car fixed right. IMO this should be included in the diminished value.

One of my conclusions is that the solution is to have a skilled, experienced, and knowledgeable body and paint specialist that you know personally stand guard 24/7 during your vehicle's repair at the body shop to witness any (and hopefully deter any) shoddy workmanship being performed to your beloved vehicle.","

My wife and I, both with iPhone 5s, are pretty much due for new ones. For all the reasons we've been discussing. Reading the reviews for the 8 vs. 7, it sure looks like the 7 would be the better buy for us, and save us $150 each. ($550 vs. $700).

But, we are long term users. Given the four years we've kept the last phones, starting out with the latest tech gives us a better chance to extend the use of the new phone. It's a dilemma.

",I don't think so--they'll just try to fire it past the new buyer; but the dealer's trade-in specialist might start looking a lot more carefully at the onboard systems to see what's working and what's not.,"Apple is, in theory, committing to supporting devices for 5 years from release day. ""Android"" has no such commitment but Google is saying at least 3 years IIRC for their devices. Samsung, LG, and others are doing whatever they feel like (I'm unaware of any support statements).

The problem is there's no profit motive in maintaining a device but lucrative profit in obsoleting it.

Same with cars; unless there's a safety concern, how much resource will an automaker throw at updates when there's no revenue to be had? I would suggest that (free) updates be supplied at minimum during the warranty period - and that includes Nav updates. But after that?

So now, got me an iPhone 6sPlus which came out in the latter part of 2015. So figure I'm good with updates until 2020 or 2021 but think I'll want something newer before that. Got mine on eBay at a very significant discount and was just lucky to win the bidding at the last moment. A brand new unit actually which is why I started to bid. Just didn't want a used one and was willing to pay a bit more for a new model.
Still don't really get the bidding on eBay though have won twice and lost once. Seemed like with each bid I made, this other guy bid right away. I only won I think because the clock ended before his could go through. Having the funds already in my PayPal account also helped as she got paid within 5 minutes of my win and I had the phone in my hand three days later, going from North Carolina to South Florida using the post office.
But like most folks, after a few years with a smartphone or any gadget, we want something new or newer. Cost also comes into play here as I have a certain limit as to how much I'll pay to do this. But if my 6s Plus works as good as it does in a few years, and if I still get the updates, see no reason to change.

Hatch or sedan? S or i model?","Thanks qbrozen!  It’s an s model (larger engine), and it’s a sedan.  Thanks so much!!!","Dang. Forgot to ask where you are. Well, about $14k ... could push to $14.5k if the dealer is really in love with it. He'd have to pay mid $14s at auction and then pay the fees and transport, so he'd still save money buying yours. If you are on the West Coast, add about $250. If you are in the Southeast, knock off $100.

Do you know what your buyout is minus any fees and taxes? (dealers don't pay the fees and taxes a private owner would.) If $14k-$14.5k is more than your buyout, then the amount above and beyond your buyout is cash in your pocket. You can either take the money and lease a new car or you can apply the money toward your new lease. If they have subvented leases with low interest, you'd probably be better off pocketing the cash and putting nothing down on the new lease.","Thanks so much qbrozen! Am located in the SF Bay Area.

Actually, I can forego all of that in this case. It is a great buy. Even if this is a FWD model, the auction value is $25k, and your buyout is a mere $1400 over that. Needing $1k in reconditioning (which I'm sure it doesn't with under 18k miles) would still be a fair buy for you. Seems like there is no downside for you if you like it.","It's all electric range is rated at 12 miles by the EPA. The BMW PHEVs have similar ranges, but some EV blogs have reported being able to double that number. PHEVs are a great fit if your daily commute is less than 20-25 miles. You can operate on electric power almost the entire time. One of our sales advisors averages over 50 mpg in his 330e.

I dunno....the price/performance ratio doesn't pencil out for me personally, although in the case ofs the 530e, perhaps it would.",Where the 530e wins is when you compare it to the 530i.

Sadly, the Cruze depreciates like a rock. The good news is that means it probably won't make a huge difference in value with the crash history. Did the sensors stop working as a result of the crash?

It's not a question of getting used to it; it's out-and-out deceptive.

Unfortunately, for that car, the difference between 48k miles and 90k miles is only a thousand bucks. Is the one on ebay also a level 2 and a 2011? $10k is still plausible if so, but that is definitely high retail. ","Looking for trade in value for 2016 Prius (Base Model), 18,500 miles in San Diego.

If you negotiate well you should be able to score a brand new mid-size sedan lease for about a $10,000 rental over 3 years and 36,000 miles. At least that's how I look at monthly lease payments; just the bottom line rental cost.

Here's a sobering thought ... the residual value on my Jetta is $10,880. I had it appraised at a VW dealer a few months back, and they offered $12K. I still have 2 years of depreciation to go, and I too am way under miles (5600 against a touch over 12K allowed, so far).",Our Jetta residual is 12.5-13k I think.

Even with cars in this price bracket, the residual values seem to be, ahem, overinflated a bit to help move inventory.

My car will likely have under 20K on the odometer at lease end, but I can't make a compelling argument to buy it out. 36 / 48 month payments on the used car will still likely be more than the lease payments on a new one, with better tech all around.","I think my sonata is in the $19k range.

Have you priced out a new 2017 with all incentives and rebates?

yes sir!... looked at the Plat... probably in the $56-57k range from a $64/65k MSRP. You'll see some Atl dealers showing $11k off MSRP, but thats w/ all incentives included. Since I don't have a trade in, I'll miss out on some incentives. The Lariat w/ the some options isn't too far behind that. And honestly, thats a little more than I want to spend, was hoping to stay around the $40 mark, to low $40's tops w/ a somewhat low mileage, good condition used and/or maybe get them to throw an ext warranty my way to cover beyond the 36.

As a generality statement, when a car/truck is right at or slightly above the 36k warranty, what does that do to a price? Let's say the same truck had 37k miles.... a grand less? I see the miles before a warranty expires as valuable to get any of the kinks out of the way on a used car... not sure how that translates to value on the sales side.

As always, appreciate your help.","it doesn't translate from what I have seen. Miles is miles.

So just taking a stab at building one and went with a 2017 supercrew Lariat 2.7L 4x4 with 502A package (nav, remote start, moonroof, etc, etc) for a total MSRP of $53,025. Incentives seem lower now than when I got mine, but looks like you could get that for $47k with some pushing (truecar shows a market average of $47,300). Not sure what more the platinum adds that is important to you. Just something to consider. Even if you got a great deal at $43k on the used one, $4k more for brand new and 2 years younger seems like a good move, IMHO."

Ive had a few dealers offer me some deals on 2017 CPOs... with the lowest being 18500+TTL+financing for a 2017 Nissan Rogue SV with 17k miles. Is this a fair deal? My target is 17500-18000+TTL+(maybe financing) and I've had dealers try to sell me 2017 CPOs at 24k (it was a rental, had cosmetic issues, was missing a key, had a tire replaced, etc). I called their bluffs several times and have seen the prices drop $5000 in less than 2 weeks.

They are truly falling out of style with the buying public, concurrent with the proliferation of crossovers. I think it is highly realistic that you would lose 60% or more in value on a five-model-year-old Ford sedan (from MSRP), even if it is a perfect, low-mileage example.","

You certainly do have equity in the car, and you will keep equity in it, too. But, it won't be the $12,500 you put in up front! Vehicles are a depreciating asset, so you cannot expect to get your money back out of it. Putting money down on it means lower payments in the future, but, as Explorer mentioned, there isn't necessarily a big advantage in doing so right now given low interest rates, and it doesn't (or shouldn't) make a lick of difference in terms of the price you pay ""out the door.""

Compared to buying the same car new, your cost of ownership will be lower because you didn't eat the initial depreciation.","
I wouldn't worry about it! Enjoy the car for what it is.

you paid 20K? Not bad at all. Say it is worth 10K after 3 years. meaning 10K depreciation too. That is about $275/month, for 40K miles. look at it another way, and that is a respectable lease payment for a car like that, but you would have gotten few miles.

Would love to join the Pacifica family from boring Honda. Beautiful car. But I'm having trouble figuring out what out the door price I should be negotiating because I feel I'm getting low balled on the trade. Here are the numbers I'm working with.

Pacifica Limited Black/Black with Uconnect Theater Package, Advanced SafetyTec Group, Tire & Wheel Group, All weather mats and cargo mat.

MSRP: $48975

Trade: 2014 Honda Odyssey Elite with 49k miles, needs four new tires

Illinois sales tax is based on difference between MSRP and trade at 7%. Hence, I'm shooting for roughly 49k - 25k trade = 24k x 7% = $1680 tax

I don't know what rebates/incentives are being put into the numbers, but I'm being quoted an OTD price of $19,200 from two dealers. They are calculating a trade of 23-24k, which seems low for the odyssey? I was aiming for $17k OTD. Should I go for the 19,200 or hold out for 17k?

I know this is asking for a lot, but any help would be appreciative. I really would love to get the family in this car. Thank you in advance. Please feel free to PM me.","You threw me with your OTD. You said $25,680 difference + tax above. But then talking about $17k? Also, I have no idea what doc fees and DMV fees are for you.","
Depends on the car I think. I'd be of the opinion that it's not that the value drops, but that the car's potential buyer base shrinks, as some people will simply not buy over 100K. So you might sell it for the same money as a 90K car, but it'll take longer.","
Actually, the question is about the trade value of the odyssey.

@qazi83 - how many miles are on it? Besides the tires, does it need any other work? How about the interior condition?

This will help the experts put a value on it.","That brown over brown VW Eos was sold this past Monday I was told Wednesday when I stopped by to test drive it. Am not surprised as it had low miles and looked brand new on the outside. Had just over 17K on the clock and they were asking just under $24K and assuming they got very close to it. They did have a couple of 2014 models there, both with miles in the low 30's. One was a white over black and the other, light blue over grey. They also were asking just under $24K for the blue one though it did have some marks on the outside. The white one has no interest for me. Left my name and number if anymore '14 models come in, since that was the last year of production from what I was told.
Learned a valuable lesson here...if you snooze, you lose! Guess the timing was off here and maybe another VW product is just not meant to be. The convertible/moonroof combo was something I liked and that brown/brown combo was stunning in the sunshine. Funny, that 2014 328i I found at the Honda store was also brown over brown with similar miles but lower price. I'd also like a blue over beige combo on either a 320i or 328i. Time will tell.

The Sandman","Odyssey was mentioned at 49K miles, I believe. I'm curious as to how you approached the deal so far, @qazi83. I would first work to figure out what I was willing to pay for the new vehicle, and work toward a sale price that meets those expectations, before worrying too much about the trade. If they can't come to a reasonable number on the trade later on, then maybe walk, but there's more than one outlet to dispose of your current ride, and it doesn't take much movement in the price to cover the difference in tax.","qazi83 said:

$24k is about right on the honda. I'm seeing about $7500 off sticker on trucar (although I can't get all the options to register) using $3k in rebates ($1k conquest, $1k customer cash allowance, $500 summer bonus, and $500 chrysler capital cash). 

So $41.5k - $24k = $17.5k plus tax and tags. Of course, I believe you have to pay tax on $20.5k. That is $1435. That is almost $19k right there as far as I can see before getting to the fees.","Q,

@qbrozen got me to thinking.. I started looking into the new car for her, as I was seeing some incentives on new X3s, and thought maybe I could bring in a lease under $500/mo. ($50K MSRP). Of course, once I start looking into leasing a vehicle, I have to check to see what used ones are selling for... and, down the rabbit hole I go.

She loves her car... she knows she needs a new one, eventually, but as long as it's reliable, she doesn't care about repairs, etc, etc.. BMW gives her a service loaner, and I usually run up and drop it off for her, so no friction. I know I've got front/rear brakes in the next year... but, unless it coughs up a transmission, I can't really come out behind by keeping it. (It's only worth $9500). Plus, a ""new"" model is out for 2018. Maybe, that will knock the price down on the 2015-2017 models, in the next year.

Accident, huh? That would explain the price. I couldn't tell you what they might have in it. Going to depend on that accident, how much was repaired, and how well it was repaired. By now, you probably know my personal take on dirty carfax. I deduct 20% off the top. That would put auction value at $28k on this and your buy price at $31k TOPS. Admittedly, they probably have more than that in it. But is that your concern? If you think you'll keep it forever, it doesn't matter. If you know you'll want to trade down the line, well, that dealer certainly won't be lenient with that dirty carfax.","Thanks. Does that mean auction value is $35K, with a clean carfax? Or, am I misunderstanding?","I paid $32K for the X3 in 2013 with 28K miles.

A little over 4 years and 66K miles later, it's worth $9500.
I'm guessing a dirty carfax wouldn't amount to much difference , now.

So, maybe I wouldn't have to keep it forever, just back up to the 90K mile level?","
Well, the lower the value, the less 20% deduct is.

I remember my A3 was worth 6K dirty, 7K clean to give you an idea. 6/7ths rule.","That was my point. If I keep the car until it's worth under $10K, then a bad carfax won't make much difference. If I can save $3K on the front end, I'll be ahead in the end.","
As long as you don't mind potential issues due to the previous wreck. In previously wrecked vehicles I've noticed the following issues that wouldn't necessarily be noticeable immediately upon return of the car right after it is fixed (time-lapsed problems):

1) reduced handling capability (probably somewhat due to less body rigidity/metal fatigue)
2) increased rattles
3) reduced paint quality, durability, resistance to chips, fading, and more.
4) more failure-prone replacement parts (even if OEM).
5) body panel gap movement/increase over time
6) cracked windshield
7) reduced safety in the event of another wreck. There's a reason manufacturer's won't CPO a crashed vehicle, and it mostly has to due with safety/liability.","

@explorerx4 I've considered it. My wife's mileage needs are hard to pin down, right now. But, they seem to be heading into the 18K/yr range. Given my experience with the current car, you may be right, though. 66K miles in 51 months. $34K cost (w/tax). Ending value of $9500. $480/mo, and all maintenance and repair on my dime, after 20 months. A lease may have been cheaper.","Anything wrong with the current x3? You are just now at the point where depreciation has slowed to a crawl so you'd be cutting it loose at a bad time, unless it is due for a ton of maintenance.","
Front/rear brakes in next 10K miles. Clean bill of health at last service, a couple of weeks ago. I get the point about depreciation, but at current mileage rate, we won't keep it that much longer. My car has 109K, and I'm only doing 6K/yr. That's the one I'll keep driving, maybe until I die.... since I passed on @breld 's GTI.",Nice X3. Steep price. Hate the all black ones interior,"

@qbrozen I know this isn't the CCBA thread, but did you suggest that I NOT buy a new car?","He did.  I'm inclined to side with him too.  After the brakes, what are you going to need by the time it hits 120K?  Oil change?  Spark Plugs?","Its for your wife, though. I'm quite happy to let my wife keep a vehicle as long as she wants!","
I think we're likely to keep the Outback for 10 years - if there was a ""fingers crossed"" emoji, I'd be using it here.

2.5 years old and around 21,000 miles on it. So long as the wife and daughter continue to work for the same employer, and share the commuting responsibilities, the miles will stay low.","Our plan was for six years when we bought it with 28K miles. My wife was retiring, and I was estimating 10K-11K mi/yr. But, last year, she took a part-time job with a non-profit, and it involves off-site visits, and her mileage has ramped up.

She doesn't have any issues with the vehicle, but I'm trying to stay ahead of the big repair costs. As I noted above, though, I'm not sure I've saved any real cash over leasing. $45K+ vehicles are expensive to drive. (you can use that, if you want )","At $9,500 current value, are you really going to lose much if you just keep it until something major pops up, or even starts peeking over the horizon? I imagine you might lose another 50% on the value of the car over the next two years of ownership, which is only $4700, and that's maybe half of what you would spend in a single year just to park any other car in your driveway.

If she's happy with it, just keep it.","

Auction values are in the mid 21s","Thanks Q - that's actually encouraging. And that makes sense that I got trade numbers previously ranging from $20-$22k.

So private party of $22k or so seems reasonable? Where do Carmax numbers usually fall in comparison to auction? I always forget.","Since a lot of people don't post follow-ups:

The Mustang checked out other than needing new tires, which I already knew about. Dealer initially came in with a trade price about $50 higher than the max I was willing to pay. I asked for an additional $1,000 off and was told no, but they did knock off a few hundred, which was enough to put it into my range.

Trade value on the 2012 Murano listed on the purchase order was $12,538, so qb hit this one pretty close.

Sale price on the 2011 Mustang GT Premium was $19,489, including approx. $390 in sales tax, so $19,099. I can't give an exact number on the sales tax since they included it in the sale price, which is an incorrect way of using the form, but the important thing is that they made my number.

3.69% financing for 48 months, but also a $199 ""prepaid finance charge,"" which makes the effective interest rate more like 5%. Not thrilled with that, but even with the $199 in fees, I'm still happy with the deal.

Never know with Carmax. Sometimes they pay auction value, sometimes not.

Private party would be stronger than that. $24k-24.5k asking and $23k taking is more like it.","
Supposedly, they did not buy the Mustang at auction--either a trade or an outright sale from a private party to them. So that might be why the numbers worked so well.

Yes, I love it. Rides great for a truck, handles great for a truck, it is damned fast for a truck. From everything I have seen and read, the 2.7 is the one to have IF you don't need to tow something massive. For some reason, the 2.7 has lower tow capacity than the others, although testing has proved it equally powerful.

I went in looking for a supercrew XL 2.7 4x4, but discovered I really needed the power seat to be comfortable, so that pushed me into an XLT. Mine came with navigation, heated power seats, tow package, tow assist, and probably other stuff I'm forgetting. I have no idea what was standard and what was optional on the XLT model. Certainly the navigation was because the one I test drove didn't have it. Oh, and I think my power rear sliding window was optional. That is kind of nice to have.

Q.. thanks for the insight, I definitely need to look hard and compare the XLT, Lariat to the Platinum... may have everything I want for thousands less.

How much life left in the tires? What about the brakes? And which engine does it have?","It has the V6 Flex Engine. I'm not really sure how much life is left on the brakes and tires, but the treads seem to have plenty left on them and the car still stops on a dime (for a jeep at least).","
Not because it's more or less reliable than the 911. It's just a better designed convertible. And, much cheaper to take a chance on.","
Its listed by a non audi dealer for 27k.","
True, but no cheaper to repair. It's a nice design but there are compromises. Larger or taller people need not apply, and there's not much in the way of passenger compartment storage. 2003 on up has a glass rear window, that's a plus."

Ha! Well, some Audi's and VW's probably depreciate almost like a donut, but there are many models that do OK I think, and I tend to get those, and also, negotiating a great deal on purchase helps.

I think he would have one the case if he made it clear he hit the brakes and stopped prior to the collision (whether that's true or not). Technically, ""Backing up"" puts a lot of burden on you to almost always be at fault with the way insurance companies think (sometimes crazy thinking). However, if you stop, your not backing up anymore.","

Because the high residual result in a low lease payment, which is the whole point.

I understand that part, which is why I suggested they just give it to you as a lease ""rebate"" incentive, which should result in the same lower payment if calculated correctly.","Because the manufacturer is insured against residuals, not against rebates.","
Exactly. They'll still make up the difference between market value and the residual value; no incentive to sell you the car for below the residual value.","Anyone have experience on a total loss claim with a leased car?

I have a feeling it is complicated a bit because your insurance will cover the value of the car, and then the ""gap"" with what your remaining payments and fees add up to, if any, would be covered by the financing/lease company. I suppose it's the same as if you buy ""Gap"" insurance on a purchase, but I have no experience with that since I don't buy cars that depreciate like donuts, nor obtain them with zero or little down.","Never used it, but that is my understanding.

M Performance models have more powerful engines, upgraded brakes, and suspension tuning that falls somewhere in between an M Sport and a full-tilt M car.
It looks like BMW is going to start making the most powerful non-M car in each series the M Performance model, see: M240i, M550i xDrive, M760i xDrive, and the X4 M40i. The G01 X3 will have an X3 M40i variant, and the hottest G20 3er will be an M340i.","

Her issue is that she's never been one to enjoy having two cars to herself. Her first MINI was supposed to be the fun companion to her X5. Well, after a few weeks, she tossed the X5 to the wayside (well, to me) and made the MINI her main car.

So, I'd say she may as well have this older, relatively inexpensive, hardtop as a fun car and keep the Clubman for a daily. But she knows herself, and she knows the Clubman would just sit around unused - which, at the end of the day, makes it more difficult for her to pull the trigger on the hardtop.","
No argument there - the GTI is the perfect fun vehicle to share, since we both like it.

True, and, depending on what the TTL and dealer fees are, it may be a reasonable approach simply to offer $5,900 OTD (rather than their asking price of $5,900+). That could be a significant (comparative) savings to you, yet come across more palatable to them at the same time.

As long as you have a maximum out-the-door target, your initial offer just has to get the conversation started. If they don't take it seriously, then you have a harder time negotiating later on. Your maximum lets you know when it is time to walk away if they won't meet you there (or lower).","Yep, I think $5900 OTD would take it.","What is my 2014 Honda Accord LX CVT with 87,000 miles worth?

You mean 10 cents per mile. And I agree. I look at it in terms of years. If driving 15k/yr, is it worth $1500 to get 1 more year out of a car? I vote a big yes on that.","

I'm with Q on this. Throw the price guides out the window on this one. I would replace that mirror cover, touch up the bumper and put it on Bring A Trailer or as Q says, the BMW message boards---I'd ask $8500 and I'd hang tough, too. Why? Because if you price out a new BMW Series 3 Sport Wagon with some options you're going to bust into $50K territory. IIRC, there is no 5 series wagon anymore.

Thanks guys! $8500 sounds reasonable--I wouldn't feel like I'm ""giving it away"". I don't plan to sell tho unless I can find a good deal on a low-mileage 2nd gen. X3. Or maybe an E91 3-series wagon--I think those are scarce tho.

The missing mirror cover--I can get a new one, primered for about $40. The primer color is black at least, so even that would look better than the missing mirror cover. But really wouldn't look right; I'll figure out where to get it painted the black body color.

The crack in the air dam under the front bumper--the local foreign car repair place said they could somehow fix that, at least better than it is--but that's the place that knocked off the mirror cover while it was there overnight (& then lied about it of course).

I dunno...I like GTIs but as the guys pointed out, this is not in fact an Autobahn, and while personally to me, the Autobahn features are of no value (obsolete NAV and leather seats don't matter to me), Q has pointed out that the Autobahn trim line does affect value. So as 28firefighter pointed out, why pay for something that isn't there?

Also black is an iffy color for me...you know, if it were like a blue or green and a true Autobahn, I'd probably be down there looking at it right now.

It's been awhile, but here I am once more with another bottom feeder from the rust belt. A friend at work has this for sale and is looking for craigslist advice:

2005 Toyota Matrix XR
Silver, 180k, stick shift manual transmission 5speed with a real clutch yes one of those.

Not babied, not abused either, commuter car from Ann Arbor [spits on floor] to East Lansing for a number of years. Basic maintenance done.

Recent brakes, good tires, no accidents, nonsmoker, clean carfax.
No sunroof, steel wheels with covers, but cruise and usual power stuff.
Rust-free to look at, a few scratches, overall good shape.

For whatever reason, he took it in and spent $500 on a brake job and oil change... he'd like to get $2,500 for it, and who knows, during tax season and in this town, he might get it. I'd be a buyer at $1,800 maybe if I needed a car, but it's 12 years old and it's got a lot of miles. Highway miles and all that, but the way we use salt here, them's dog years..

So, cleaned up and with good pix, what does he ask in his ad, and what can he expect to get..?
Thanks in advance,
-Mathias"," For whatever reason, the automatics are pretty strong even with high miles. Sticks are getting far less, however, so maybe at best a $1500 auction car. So I think getting 2500 should be pretty easy. I would start asking 3495 and go from there.","Thanks, Q,
That was quick...

I think I know why the sticks get ""far less"" -- while the six-speed in the XR-S is stout, the pedestrian manual transmission in this car and the Corolla tends to fail at high-ish miles and is over $3,000 to fix. IOW the car turns to junk instantly. One reason this one is still good is probably a lot of highway driving. I heard about it on Click & Clack years ago, and a friend of mine had that happen while he was moving between jobs. Not fun.

Who'd'a thunk that Toyota of all people would mess up a stick shift.
Of course I don't know how prevalent this really is.

The CT car is identical to the other, yes, except that it doesn't have the ""Plus"" features (and a few more miles). They're asking $14,850 on that one, so it sounds like that one is listed at a good price already. The other? They're asking $18K, which I think is way too high.","

Naugatuck.

If you want to take a look at it, I certainly won't dissuade you! This is the dealer listing.

Looks pretty solid from the photos, but I know these cars well enough to know their typical faults. One thing that annoys me about this listing is that the dealer lists it as a ""Plus Package,"" when it clearly does not have a plus package. Plus, according to authoritative sources, includes fog lights, navigation, and a backup cam. All manual premiums in 2013 include heated seats and mirrors.

Typical issues I find with Subaru: Interior door, dash, and liftgate rattles (I mean constant ones, not just in response to significant bumps or harsh surfaces). For New England cars, undercarriage (subframe) corrosion and corrosion of engine accessories (such as PS, AC, alternator, and pulleys). This car should be pretty young for such issues, but that stuff can creep up quickly if properly neglected in that environment.

Carfax lists both of the cars as having two previous owners, but otherwise no blemishes.","@xwesx - Looks like Naugatuck is about an hour north of where I live. The earliest I could get up there would be next Thursday. The car looks clean in the pictures and I'm nowhere nearly as mechanically inclined or knowledgeable as you, but if you want me to take a ride up there to test drive the car for you, I will.

If you decide to pull the trigger, see if you can get some sort of connecting flight into Westchester County Airport (HPN), I can pick you up and take you up to Naugatuck. It gives me an excuse to put some miles on the Infiniti!","
If you're willing to make that run, I'm interested in whatever report you give (mechanically inclined or no!). Your Subaru experience is recent enough that you'll likely pick up on anything that doesn't seem right.

I am not in super-serious mode yet, but I think I'll be disposing of our '10 this afternoon (third try is the charm, right?), so all the chips are in place. This is my wife's car, so if she green lights it, then I'll pull the trigger. She has certain criteria (e.g., she wants the car she had before), but one of my criterion is that it is 2011-2013 so that it has the FB engine in it. So, color is out (paprika was 2010 MY only), but she insists on black interior and manual transmission. Pickings = slim! Haha

It looks like flying into HPN would be brutal! I did a little bit of flight browsing last night, and mileage tickets are out due to them being extraordinarily high (burned most of my miles on the four-person jaunt to Houston last month!). Price isn't a deal-breaker, but the timing of flights is just so brutal. I would probably need at least a day to recuperate just to be able to drive home. LOL

I suggested he look at the price of parts, which I estimated at $400, and we could replace them ourselves in the garage.

Probably not a viable option, but I'd even consider another TTS (though depreciation will probably dissuade me). Just exploring my options.

I have no compunction or guilt to tracking an A3 quattro loaner while mine is in the shop, but I'd really REALLY REALLY rather track my TTS. I doubt my wheels/tires would fit the A3 correctly, so that's part of it. A lot of money tied up in those wheels and tires. Not even sure my wheels would fit a Golf R as they may have a bit less clearance for the width of a 255/35R19 on 19x9 wheels.","
Residual values on leases are often inflated. The numbers Q gave you earlier took your miles into consideration. The fact that it wound up at a level near your lease residual was more coincidence (due to low miles) than anything.

What I took away from the provided information is that you are *not* going to be able to get to a level that is reflective of retail value (~$18K) on this vehicle. You can turn it in at lease end and be done with it, or you may be able to trade out of it without negative equity, but you don't have any positive equity in the vehicle.","
Ouch! About what I figured though.

As far as the drips, the leak is so slow that no one would notice if you cleaned it, unless they drove the car really hard, getting it really hot, which is probably where 99% of the drips come from (only when it's hot and flows), but even then, just a couple drops at a time.

They are going to fix it, as far as I know so far, but still haven't been given a clear timetable on if a new rear diff has been ordered, and when it'll arrive if so.

They better get back to me this afternoon.

I think I can talk them into upgrading my '15 A3 quattro loaner into a '17 A4 quattro loaner. Those new A4's get quite expensive. 3,600 lbs fully loaded though; quite a car.","
I saw this pop up local to me. One of these might be a cheaper option to the Yota, but from my looking, still not really cheap. At least it is a V6.

They are replacing the diff for a leak? Good grief what have we come to.","Wait, that's a 2004 Frontier at $9K? Those things hold their value pretty well, too! That is the last year of the previous generation. Sadly, the current generation came into production for 2005. Still, it's a solid design and a good truck, so if you can get ahold of one for significantly less than a Tacoma, then I'd say go for it!","

Sold for $19K, if all goes well at the bank.

Wow. Good price. No pics on their site yet. Worth a call. Do I want to drive 8 hours through an impending snow event?","If you really wanted it, can leave a deposit on website to hold. Refundable. And if serious, I live 5 minutes away and always to go scope it out.","

He drove it 250k with minimal issues and just sold it because he bought my Pathfinder.","Same engine and running gear as our Pathfinder that was totaled in a fender-bender in November with 170K on it and absolutely no running gear issues beyond a small oil cooler leak, easily fixed."

Hahha! Yeah, I was going to say that I strongly suspect @stickguy does not walk that talk.....","So, is there a rule of thumb on what amount over auction (or trade) represents a strong deal?

Generally, I've targeted $3,000 over, thinking that's a fair profit and generally a good deal as a buyer. Perhaps a bit more if I really have to have the car; a bit less if I want an aggressive deal.",I target $2500 over auction as fair for both parties.,,"
For the sake of coming up with a difference, can you tell me current values for my Durango?:

Thanks!",$21k-$21.5k trade,"Okay - so $36k trade value on the 2017 R/T, $21k on my 2014 SXT. Difference of $15k plus, let's say $2,500 profit - for a $17,500 difference.

They bottomed out at $18,500 today. Not all that bad really. More of a question of whether it's worth it to me for the upgrade.

Not that it matters (the only difference is the difference, right?), but the sales manager, who seemed a bit irked at me for being open about auction values and such, claimed they took in the R/T trade at $39k, so they're not budging much on that side of things. Doesn't really matter though - they're obviously over-allowing on my rig, offering $23k trade.

Thanks for the response Q!","
Funny how a little knowledge can annoy sales folks.","Yeah, I really try to be transparent about my approach to pricing, but without being presumptuous. I like to provide some support for why I'm offering what I'm offering, so they don't think I'm just throwing numbers out willy nilly.

When I simply stated that I generally target somewhere around auction value plus $2,500 or so, the sales manager snickered and asked if I ever actually get that (remember, this is at a very nice Mercedes dealer). I just simply replied, ""sometimes.""

To be fair, he understood the approach and tried to show me that the auction values may be higher than what I thought (but he struggled to find any data on such a new vehicle).","I would have said ""often I do better than that but I'm feeling generous today.""

I have pissed off countless salespeople and GMs. But it is the few who have said ""yeah that's fair"" that make it worthwhile.

Now, granted, $18.5k difference is actually correct if you use auction value, not trade value.","So, trade is generally a little lower than auction, with dealers hedging their bets a bit?

Are you saying the $18.5k difference is a decent/good offer then?

If you are way under-miles, it seems it would perhaps be easier. But time is money too, right? So let's say you hit the 36,000 mile threshold 6 months early.

It happens. It is the carmax way of doing business, too (sometimes). A dealer steps up on the trade because they want it for themselves. If they bought it at auction for $30k, for example, they pay fees and transport and clean it up, etc, bringing them to $31k anyway. Obviously, however, more often than not, they pay $1k back of auction value on a trade so they can get rid of it at auction themselves, if they need to."

Oh, well, I'm of the opinion that VW/Audi's automatic transmissions (and admittedly 99.8% of my driving miles are on DSG's in regards to Audi/VW transmissions), have for a long time (at least since '06) had that S gear on the selector not just as a way to raise the RPM's of your shift points, but to overall increase the driving excitement and performance the car offers. Opening up the engine/throttle, exhaust, and of course, shifting more aggressively, quicker, and letting you venture a little bit into the red-line before shifting.

it was ""DRIVE SELECT"" prior to them being able to create a button for it and market it at extra cost nowadays!!! Of course, now there can be no doubt the car's personality changes with ""drive select"" and it can make changes to the steering weight and suspension settings (if your car is equipped properly).","tifighter said:

You are correct about no comps. I have 2 in CA with auto trannies. 64k miles for $13.8k and the other with 77k for $11.5k.","Happens when starting from a dead stop. Like this morning, waiting to get across traffic to get on the expressway. A car is coming but enough room to go, I hit the gas and...nothing for a split second, then it goes.

That does sound like a good price, although both the manual transmission is usually considered a minus on a car like that--I mean, for the ""usual"" type of buyer for that car.

This car has a consistent maintenance history since new, and the V6 has an okay rep generally. But at 75k miles, you know there is a surprise waiting somewhere.

Average auction is about $28k. There are a couple super clean ones that broke $30k, but I always gotta stick with the average. So I'd say $31k-$32k tops for non-CPO. I can't really state what CPO adds on a Lexus. I guess it is worth what you are willing to pay for the benefit.","

Ha! Thanks! A $5K markup for a CPO warranty seems excessive. The high mileage one almost seems like a better deal for me from a mileage standpoint.

$14-15k at the block, so figure $18k is the end of the world unless it is cpo",I could like with a decently equipped low mile 320i for that money. I assume this is price for an S RWD? How much does Xdrive add up in NJ?,"According to Siri, the 320i is about 185"", while my Golf is 168"". Would fit but just barely. Again, all comes down to timing and mine's pretty well off right now. Was close to the dealer yesterday on my n/s day but didn't go over since I knew it was just a waste of time. I'd probably have loved it but know the other half wouldn't and she'd make my life hell for awhile. And like Stick has said, I do prefer a hatch on at least one vehicle. Plus, the Golf has been flawless since the starter wire incident. Combined with the new sneakers and the pre-paid 30K service, just makes zero sense to trade at this juncture!
Final decision just made! Anyways, think a private sale for the Golf is the better way to go. Just need the right customer who has the money needed.

The Sandman","I have had my fill of private sales. Unless I buy for temporary use something cheap (just to have a spare), will likely stick with trading it in, taking the tax credit, and saving mu sanity.

Actually, it doesn't cost the dealer "" a fraction"" of the cost to have work done. The Service Dept typically bills the Sales Dept nearly as much as customer pay.

They initially offered him $12.5, then came up to $13, then said they can't give him a penny more than $13.5.  He showed them the $14K that CARMAX offered him & they agreed to take his trade in at $14K.

now the guy just has to decide on which MB he wants.  He's trying to decide between an E350 Drop Top or a CPO SL.","I leased an '04 6-speed V6 Accord EX-L that I was told was worth 50% of new in just 2 years, so keep that in mind.

As for the Civic, isell gave you a good number of $4500.","Got 2 cars looking to get a realistic trade in value on, living in Knoxville, TN.

Completely agree - when we say it's ""not your problem"" that the dealer has too much in a car, that's true because you don't have to buy it, not that they have to reduce their price.

And ""would a buyer come along and overpay"" for a car? I imagine if dealers are patient enough, that's exactly what happens oftentimes. Despite all the information available out there, I believe there are a lot of consumers unfamiliar with what we consider to be fair pricing.","Well sometimes a buyer finds the exact used car they want--right color, options, mileage, condition.

There are no ""used car factories"" putting out exactly what everyone wants in a used car. I remember in my own case I had a very specific set of requirements---green body, black roof, sunroof, heated seats, leather, stick shift, supercharged, under 50K miles. These were absolutely the non-negotiable items. Took me a while to find one, and when I did, I paid almost dealer retail. The dealer really dug in on me. I suspect he paid a good price for it.","

I'm gonna say $8k-$9k. You won't see them cutting you any breaks on the repair. Thing is, most dealerships I have talked to separate sales and service.

2008 Mini Cooper S Clubman, 75K, 6-speed manual, pano, all options except NAV, pepper white with black trim. San Francisco Bay Area. Very clean car. Dealer is asking $9,500, I'm thinkin' retail is $8,000--$8,500, but this is a strong market for those cars, so.....","A white 6-spd with 73,780 miles went through the SF auction at $5k on the nose. So $8k would prob be my upper limit and start them at 7.

That sounds good. Edmunds pegged the car at $6K retail in ""outstanding"" condition but I don't think that's going to happen to anybody around here. 

$8K wouldn't be a great buy but I have to say this car is cherry top to bottom. ","Hello, can you please give me the Karpower, or ballpark numbers for my trade.

I live in central cali, but most likely will trade in the the bay area","Not sure what Karpower is.

Anyway, that is a TON of miles on a 2015. I have absolutely no comps for that. There was one in poor condition with 46k that went for $15.5k. If yours is real nice, $14k might not be far off the mark on a trade.","
Well he says that with it I get the 3.9% rate, but I honestly don't know if that's true or not. He says that when the bank sees that it's been certified, they give you the lower rate because of that. I wonder if anyone here knows if that's true.

Yes. Here's the thing. There's what he calls the ""Internet Price"" and the ""Sticker Price."" Internet price is what's listed on the net, which is a price set to compete with all other internet sellers. So THAT price, he says, is NOT negotiable. That price is $21k, yes. The Sticker price (sticker on the window) is $24,000. He said if someone is looking for a car, he negotiates down from THAT price. But with me, since I know him, he gave me the internet price from the start and then discounted me the AIP (?) fee (which is $1,800), but asked me to pay $250 ""under the table."" I also told him I didn't want the CPO warranty, but still wanted the 3.9% rate and he said the manager said that if I gave them $400, so that he can pay off the finance guys, he could make that happen.

So he's basically doing two things: dropping the fee of $1,800 and keeping the 3.9% fee, but asking me to pay him $400. So not dropping the 21K price by even a penny, but simply doing what I just mentioned and that's all. What do you think? I mean all the shadyness aside, if we can focus on just one thing: the price of the car, would you say it's worth it or no?",You can negotiate an internet price too. Lot of BS going on here. No under the table payments. Not a good way to do business.,"Wow. So much BS.

Should be more like a volunteered Dinner and Drinks tonight on me at most; so maybe $50 tops for doing a ""favor.""

I'd run away!","Thanks, guys. Three things I was really hoping you all could clarify for me, as these three things specifically are what I've been dying to find out, but have been unable to thus far, as I don't know many people to ask.

1) The price listed on the internet, do salespeople add fees and taxes ON TOP of that price? Or are the fees and taxes included?

2) When you walk into an actual dealership and the price they have listed online is $20,999, is it a normal, everyday thing to be able to walk out of there after taxes and after all fees have been added to final (out-the-door) price and pay LESS than $20,999?

3) Focusing strictly on price for this model, this amount of miles, 2015 and fully loaded, what is a good out-the-door price? I don't know of any way to check dealership sold prices, so I don't know how any of you would reach that conclusion, so if you could please explain to me how the number you provide is current market value, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks again.

21 out the door, you mean? Or before fees and taxes? What do you personally think is a good price for the speifici car I posted about. 2015 Toyota Camry XLE 4 Cyl, with 14,000 miles, fully loaded, leather seats, bluetooth, sunroof, navigation.

Same question. 21k out the door? Or before fees and taxes?","Look at Edmunds Price. From the home page, select Used Cars at the top, then Appraise Car. Put in all relevant information and then you'll have a good idea of what you might reasonably expect to pay. All dealer offers are before taxes. Unless, after some negotiation, they offer you a written OTD price.","@videolife - there's no easy answer to those questions, as they are all based on what the dealership is asking/advertising for the vehicle. And unfortunately, there's certainly no standard on how individual dealerships price their cars - some do indeed offer fair value pricing on their vehicles, while others inflate the asking prices by thousands, just to ""allow"" a buyer to negotiate down. Some tack on additional fees that are simply additional profit labeled as ""fees"" to suggest that they are non-negotiable.

All that is to say, what a dealership is listing a car for is almost meaningless. This forum is excellent in providing information on what a fair price for a car is.

So...@qbrozen said that Camry has an auction price of around $16k, which more or less approximates what it ""cost"" the dealer. While a ""fair"" profit is debatable for sure, generally $2-3k would be considered ""fair,"" thus leading to q's estimate of $19,000 being a fair price for the car.

That is $19,000 plus taxes. In fact, when I offer a price for a car, I specifically state it as $XX amount ""plus taxes,"" so as to avoid any confusion on additional fees and such.

That said, Camrys, and often Toyotas in general, often bring silly prices on the used market. $20-21k for a certified example may indeed be what the dealers are getting - which simply brings us to @stickguy's point: for something like a Camry (or an Accord, or a 4Runner, etc.), it's often a better deal just to buy a new one than a slightly used one.

Truecar.com shows an average $4,400 off a new Camry XLE, at least for my region. I think that gets you to a point where $21k for one that's 2 model years and 14k miles old may not make much sense.","Agreed, @breld. Until you start getting the numbers on paper, it is hard to say what they included in the advertised price of the car, and what they plan to add on top of it.

Generally, the advertised price does not include any fees such as ""deal doc fees"" and TTL, or ""tax, title, and license."" However, if you say you want the car for ""$21,000 out the door,"" that means the price plus all other taxes and fees. Then the dealer has to go back and decide what that translates to for the price of the car. TTL is the part that neither party has control over; everything else is negotiable!","You have to keep in mind the old adage ""all new cars are the same, all used cars are different'. In terms of price, you really don't know how much the dealer has in the car. It's possible, for instance, that he's in deeper than the auction reports suggest he should be--he might bid up on a car that he thinks has potential for ""above book"" profit, or someone might have goofed on a trade and now the dealer is in too deep on recon costs. Those cars can be harder to buy.","pet peeve. On a trade, dealers hammer you with up to the minute reductions in trade value. But on their cars, market value seems to be irrelevant when they price based on ""what they have in it"". Because if they overpaid, their problem, not mine.","breld: Thanks a million for your detailed reply. By ""plus taxes"" you mean that it's included in the $19,000, right? Not $19,000 plus whatever taxes are available?

And yes, after having called a few dealerships today, I did the same thing. Made sure there wasn't another single penny added to the OTD cost. So for pretty much the same vehicle, I got around $20,000 OTD. $3,000 less than the other place. So I'm going to go in there and see what happens to the price after financing.

Which brings me to another quick question. I read somewhere (either on here or City Data) where (unless I'm misread or possibly even took what he said out of context) some guy said that he doesn't mention his down payment until after they give him the OTD price. Why is that? How would that negatively affect him (or me)?

@videolife ------Well it's true that if the dealer is buried in the car that's ""not your problem"" in one sense---but in another sense it is very much your problem, because he's not going to sell it to you at a loss, no matter what ""book"" is or what other dealers are selling a similar car for. He's not going to eat a loss. He could keep the car for a year if he wanted to until he finds his buyer.","
Would a buyer really come along in a year to overpay? What if it NEVER sells?","When I traded in my Vibe, the dealer advertised it at a ridiculous price. They left it there for nearly a year, finally dropping the price enough that I guess someone eventually bought it.","When I say ""loss"" I mean the dealer taking less than his usual minimal profit margins. He may in fact eventually have to sell it at a break-even price, but most dealers who have been in business awhile avoid sinking money into trade-ins and just wholesale the edgy ones.

My point was that the dealer is under no obligation to meet your expectations of what's ""fair"". What's fair to you may not be fair to him because the profit margin on other similar cars you are comping against might be higher than his.

Short answer--if he lets you walk away with your offer, and doesn't call or contact you, you're out.","qbrozen said:

But the tires on there did behave very well in the wet, and I started thinking that I wanted to take the money while the taking was good, so I left the tires alone. 5,000 miles later, when I did the buyback, the tires had not appreciably worn, and were still working very well, wet or dry.

This new (to me) Chrysler Town & Country has 6/32 at all 4 corners on what appears to be the original set of tires. A little quick math says 11/32 new, now at 6/32 after 34,800 miles, so approximately 7k miles per 1/32 of tread. If I'm at 6/32, and want to replace at 4/32, they should be good for another 14k miles. Maybe. Hopefully. Fingers crossed.

After all, it has been a number of years (at least 6 or 7) since I kept a car for that many miles (14k). Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm wasting a lot of money this way. But what the hell, I have no intention of leaving any money behind!","
For winter tires? Yes, definitely, as I notice their traction really dropping off at about that point. So, when that winter is done... so are they! I mean, I could use them for the following summer before replacing, but since I already have a set of tires for that season, it isn't often that my summers are in need of replacement at the same time as the winters. If they were, then I could just put off replacement of the summer set for a year. Otherwise, the summers end up aging another year without use, and they already tend to last five or six years.

As Q noted, the tires are still good a 6/32, and I never have any problems selling them on Craigslist for pretty cheap. I'm glad that others can use them down and happy to share that wealth. They just aren't good for my purposes!

I should also note that winters usually come with 12/32. The worst wearers (Bridgestone, Continental, and Michelin were all about the same at 2/32 per year) last me three years, and I got five years out of my first set of Goodyear UGI.

This is using them for at least six months of each year. I usually put them on around 10/1 or a little sooner, and they don't come off until after 4/1. And, yes, we typically have snow and ice on the roads for most, if not all, of that period.","

Interesting question. Galves may help in this case. That had  a table telling you how much deduction per 1000 miles by brand.

The Venn diagram with @breld and Kia is about as close as the earth and the sun.","does Kia have a big SUV now? I pay no attention to them.

Hyundai might be close enough. The large Santa Fe is a really nice larger Ute.","
Depends on what you mean by big. Sorento is the largest SUV in the lineup. They used to offer the Borrego, which was a body-on-frame RWD SUV.","Kia's Sorento is actually pretty nice, and I actually sat in a couple Santa Fe's at the store today and thought they presented better than the Infiniti I was in. Pretty taken with the Durango though.

Riding out the lease is indeed the smart thing to do. Though if I found a dealer willing to step up a bit more toward the lease buyout, I'd consider that. Otherwise, certainly no sense in ""giving"" the use of the car away for the next year.","
Guess I know which brands we'll be hitting at the auto show in a few months!

I'm gonna go on record and say that a Durango with a Hemi will be a punch some time this year.","
Seconded.","
It's nice that you think I'll last a few months.

In fact, my wife is busy helping a friend do some painting for the entire afternoon. She told me I should go look at some SUVs.",you people are amazing. I think I mean that in a good way...,Those Durangos look like something from the Automotive World That Time Forgot. What speaks to you about it?,"Well, I like the more ""brute"" look of the exterior compared to some other crossovers. The interior isn't all that exciting, but has a quality feel - much more so than a few other domestics I've looked at (Explorer, Acadia/Traverse). The UConnect system is nice and user-friendly.

The driving dynamics of the Durango (in my opinion, of course) are dramatically different (in a good way) than the Infiniti JX35 I drove (and presumably the Pathfinder as well). I have yet to drive an Explorer or Traverse. Highlanders and Pilots drive very pleasant, but not as engaging as the Durango. The CX-9 is nice, and I still may consider one, but been there done that.

So, regardless of price, I do like the Durango better than most competitors - what's nice is since they do depreciate quite a bit, there are good deals to be had.","I happen to think the Enclave is pretty sweet, or the GMC Acadia. Never driven either though.",Our Enclave rides and drives beautifully and has been perfect except for warped rotors. The biggest problem is the tech is behind the times. No keyless start and the NAV screen isn't that big.,"I drove an Acadia when it first came out back in, when was that.... maybe early 2007? My wife hated it. She thought it was big, cumbersome, and gaudy. LOL","I sat in a Traverse and Enclave earlier today - I definitely liked the roominess of the interior and the layout with the captains chairs in the second row. The dash overall seemed outdated to me. I will probably take a test drive one of these days.

A couple years ago Motor Trend did one of their ""Big Test"" comparisons of 3-row SUVs, with all the usual suspects, and they picked the Durango as #1. That surprised me and is precisely what got me to go take a look at them.

2016 Chrysler T&C Touring, 17k miles, for $16,990. Which is too cheap, so I call and ask why. They tell me it has a salvage title (Rebuilt Title in Texas) due to “hail damage”. When pressed, they have no actual information, claim to have bought it at auction for $16,500 and “just trying to get my money back”. I tell him he paid too much, and I wouldn’t consider it for a dime more than $15k.

So today, he calls me back and says he will take the $15k. I’m thinking of driving down Monday afternoon to take a look, but it would really help if I could get any information.

The VIN is 2C4RC1BG1GR165070

@qbrozen, would you take a look and see if you can find it on any auction listings?

And I think one of the regulars here can run Carfax reports? I would really appreciate any and everything you can find.","
From what I've read in several forums and CR, early model years to around 2011 Traverse, Acadia, etc. are very trouble prone with lots of ac, transmission and electrical gremlins. I had a Traverse as a loaner and found that it drove well and was very comfortable and my wife really liked it.","
well, certainly plenty of red flags on this one. Sounds like the dealer screwed up on the buy, and wants you to bail him out of his mess. Could be good, if you are going to keep it and run into the ground. But very possibly no longer covered by factory warranty, and who knows what evils lurk beneath. You might think you are getting in cheap, but it could get expensive quick (and if you need to bail out).

actually, at this point, the dealer probably figured out what he actually has. Hence the quick taking of your lowball price!","
It will be interesting if a Car Fax will identify anything specific. If it doesn't have structural or flood damage it maybe worth a thorough inspection and like you said, if willing to keep long term, a decent buy.","
CARFAX says ""FLOOD DAMAGE"". Van is out of Iowa, also listed as rental vehicle.",Yikes!!!  Run away!!,Agree. Run away. ,"Oh, if a flood car, just run away.

I don't see it, and I don't think Manheim would sell such a car, so he must have gotten it elsewhere. Thing is, clean ones with under 20k are $19k all day long at auction, putting fair retail right about $21-22k. Half price for a salvage vehicle puts you at $10k-$11k.",Hail or high water.

And yes, flood damage is a most definite ""Don't go there!!!"".","
Appreciated as always, @qbrozen. I've been looking for a clean one with under 20k miles, at around $21 to $22k, just as you describe. And I haven't found any, at least not locally. I find many with 34k to 45k miles, going for around $19k or $20k. On the 17th, I'm getting $22k for my Passat TDI, and I would love to turn that into a nice low mileage T&C.

But all of the late model T&C minivans out there are all ex-rental vehicles, there seem to be no exceptions to that. And the rental companies are not turning them over until they have more miles than what I am looking for. And they're just not really ""clean"".

And speaking of clean, they're mostly not even washed. Forget detailed, the dealerships these days don't seem to even invest in a decent car wash / vacuum job.

So I guess I'll keep looking. And once again, thanks for the help here from @Mr_Shiftright and @qbrozen."

Kia doesn't retain its value like a Honda. One reason Honda's lease well is higher residuals that are not just inflated figures.","

I would hope they would since then the warranty really should matter, but it is tough to say for sure.","I love the obsession with AWD on this little CUVs. Because I am fine with FWD, and if it saves a couple of grand, great!",But then just buy a Honda Fit and save way more! ;b,"
We had friends here in Denver get two consecutive FWD Santa Fes. At first I didn't understand it but now I sorta do. You still get the increased ride height, but without the weight and mpg penalty of AWD.

Like I've always maintained, there are about 10 days a year here where you need AWD. However, finding a FWD or RWD vehicle that is available with AWD is almost impossible.

I can't imagine how far you'd have to travel to find a FWD Audi A4, for example.","A buddy of mine made fun of our Enclave because it is not AWD. I just don't feel we need it in south Jersey. If I was buying it maybe I would have sprung for it for better resale, but on a lease I'll save $40-$50 month difference and 1-2 MPG penalty.","Pretty sure that if my RDX was FWD (as many were at the local dealer at the time) I never would have been able to tell. Certainly my wife wouldn't.

I asked the salesguy ""oh, I thought this was AWD?"" He said he thinks it is, to which I commented that it must not work very well. After we returned, he double checked and confirmed it was FWD.","Yeah, two of my sister-in-laws both bought FWD Equinox. In Fort Wayne, IN. One of them was coming out of an AWD 3-series.

We've gotten what? 1 major storm since then?

If it is bad enough, I'm not taking the kids to daycare and will simply work from home.","
In Denver and environs? You probably will never need AWD.","
Shhh! Don't say that too loud; you'll scare off all the dealers and transplants who feel that they've just gotta have AWD or 4WD.

Depends on where you live... and, which vehicle. CR-V isn't as big of a deal. RWD Grand Cherokee in the Midwest? Ouch.","But doesn't that work both ways? I mean, if you were after a 2016 leftover Cherokee with RWD in the Midwest, you'd probably get yourself a helluva deal.","
It doesn't rain often where I'm at, but when it does, and I'm in the AWD TTS, I make it a point to leave 2WD cars in the watered down dust at stoplights. It is hilarious how fast you can accelerate on wet pavement, while everyone else is driving like there is ice on the ground.

On a Sunday morning drive in the twisties a Ford Focus ST left me in the dust, but mostly because they were more willing to pass slowpokes on the 2-lane highway crossing double yellows in questionable zones than I was. I also suspect he had mods done to that car; came up from behind me when I was behind a slow poke and I thought it might be a RS. I let him pass me after I passed the slowpoke when a passing lane came up, but then another slow car came up in front of me shortly thereafter, and he had already passed them where there was no passing lane.","
No... then, it would be ""rare"". Haven't you ever talked to a car salesman?","I also enjoy AWD for jackrabbit 90 degree turn starts, such as at a red-light right turn. Tough to do a jack rabbit start with either FWD or RWD and turn 90 degrees at the same time. I like the feeling of all 4 wheels working for me, but maybe it's partly mental.","
the same 2 faced story I heard every time I was in about a stick shift. Premium priced because rare when buying, but unsellable when trying to trade one in so get lowballed. Really can't have it both ways.","Man, I need a good rap like that....I win, you lose, either way....brilliant!","
I get the same story when I complain to salesman why every car on the lot is black and white. They tell me they have a red one that just came in, and it'll probably still be parked there 6 months later.","I actually had a surprisingly pleasant experience when I traded in my manual S4 last year at the Audi dealership. They recognized it as a rare, desired vehicle and said as much, and provided a really strong trade value as a result.

Never had that experience in the past when trading in manual trannie BMWs. Always went the private sale route for those.","Thanks for the input on trade in. The CRV test drove fine but after longer trips it seemed restrictive. It had way better legroom than the escape, but I felt the Ecoboost 2.0 drove way better.

It's definitely an odd duck, but something about the design speaks to us. Those few who liked it and bought new for mid-$30k's certainly are not faring well with depreciation.

No, I decided to hang back. There are some very good deals out there for the end of the year, but I still don't know what I want to do next.

I don't think there is a MINI available that rides like your Golf. Maybe the new Clubman.","Probably true.

At this stage, not sure what I'd really want next as everything I try or even look at just isn't as nice as the Golf. So, as long as no issues crop up, looks like the Golf will stay in the stable for awhile. Averaging just about 13K miles each year so even if I continue working till the end of 2018, I'd still be at about 52K two years from now. And if it stays as flawless as it's been up to now, I'll be real happy! That initial issue with that starter wire was really a one in a million issue, not something normal, so don't really think about it. Like the wife's A3, both have been very reliable.

Nav helps but only about $500. $27.7k is too much, IMHO. ","Is it just me, or do all of the ""no haggle"" dealerships seem to be really high priced? The prices at CarMax seem to be truly outlandish, and yet I see tremendous numbers of cars on the road with CarMax stickers.

Probably a reflection of how much people hate the typical car buying experience, which can be avoided at Carmax, I'll give you that.","
Thanks q. Looks like it's staying with me for the next 24 months.","
I tend to agree. There are some exceptions, but generally they are overpriced by $1000-$2000.

What I will give CarMax is that they excel at the logistics of leveraging their massive network of vehicles. It is very easy to have a car transported to your local CarMax without obligation to purchase.

Also, I've read some pretty crazy stories about how good their extended warranty is, so for someone who wants to own an exotic car but is worried about the repairs, you pay a premium to have access to that warranty.",My experience looking has been that yeas the are expensive. You pay for the comfort.,"I agree, prices at CarMax tend to be high. Every once in a while I'll find a car priced where I think it is a good value, but not often. I have sold 3 cars to CarMax and the process was very easy. That was when they would offer more than what I could get from the dealer when I was ready to trade. In the past year or so I have found that they tend to bid low so I haven't given them the pleasure of my business.","We have another chain in the NJ area called Autolenders. Similar business model to Carmax. They are also extremely high, but as I'm sure Stick and Q can attest to there are plenty of those stickers on cars in the area.

I sold my 09 Genesis to them for $1100 or so above my buyout (27 months into my lease) then they put it for sale $6000 above that and it was off their website in a week.","kyfdx said:

But that would incentivize everyone that has been in an accident to claim it was just stolen parts! Hard to control, police, and regulate that. Better to play it safe IMO as a buyer. Any who! how many cars get panels stolen? That was unusual.","
Mid-size sedans are about as popular as horse wagons right now apparently, and an extremely crowded competitive marketplace with many different qualified choices. Therefore, the new ones are highly discounted, thereby making the used market less attractive unless prices plummet there too.","
I have tracked a few commodities on CarMax to realize they have some kind of pricing scheme whereby more or less they will lower the price $500 a pop every 7 days or so to move the car. If a sucker doesn't come along in the first 2 weeks someone will save a grand from their outlandish prices, and that could explain partly why they are so popular.","
I bought my new '14 S4 in part because I was able to negotiate a deal whereby an equivalent S4 model at Carmax that was two years older ('12 model) would be about the same money. Only difference being I was willing to forgo tech like Navigation and rear cameras whereas of course all the used ones have that. People pay crazy money for gadgets.","Bradd you are pretty stiff on miles too, so that has to take a big hit. Plus that is trade, not retail. I assume I could walk in and buy a 2017 like yours for 24-25K? So trade at 11-12, they retail for 14-15K, which seems like a reasonable drop for 2 years/44K miles.

Well, as most of you know from other threads, we did pull the trigger on a new MINI. Based on the advice here (thanks @qbrozen, @Mr_Shiftright and @28firefighter), we are planning on going the private sale route, but the dealership is gonna take a look at it tomorrow when we pick up the new MINI just to see if it makes sense on trade. I'm thinking private sale around $10k, likely a touch under to get into the ""4 digits"" instead of 5. If they somehow came up to $8k on trade I'd be tempted to take that plus the $500 tax savings and call it a day. I'll report back.
Just reporting back - dealer came up to $8,000 on the trade, so we went ahead and took them up on it.  

With some real minor damage on the rear bumper and a fender panel that was slightly misaligned, not to mention the car saying service  was due, we thought it was a reasonable way to go.

Ask them if you are getting dinged for panel replacement(s). They will answer you. That's probably it; Carmax is picky on accident damage evidence, as they should be.","Perhaps, but it seems like there should be a difference between a crash and a stolen part. In a private party sale, the buyer's perception would surely be different in those scenarios.","I walked around the lot at CarMax with a salesman, while waiting for the appraisal on my truck. I had him unlock about 20 different cars so that I could do a trial fit (headroom, knee room, etc). A couple of surprises, at least to me: A Prius V and a Nissan Juke. Who would've thought?

While engaged in all of these trial fittings, a customer walking the lot by himself approached my salesman and asked if that were all of the trucks they had. I had not noticed before, but there were very few pickups. Only around 10 or 12 total. Here in Texas, they sell a LOT of pickup trucks. And someone looking for a pickup truck is not going to settle for anything else. Which made me anticipate a good offer for my truck, but alas, not to be.

They had a fair number of SUVs, but less than I would have expected. What they had was a boatload of cars. Like someone in their management failed to get the memo: ""People aren't buying cars anymore, they're buying SUVs and trucks.""","
You were spot on. $5K is what it traded for. I had dealers offering $4500-$5000 so it was fairly consistent.

There are two other boards where many of us gather to share (or just read/lurk) stories. You may want to check them out. One is called ""Edmunds Members - Cars and Conversations"" and the other is ""Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous,"" though that title is somewhat misleading. Many of the guys on there acquire new rides on an annual (or even more often) basis, but they still tolerate someone like me. I buy a car for myself or my wife about once every 5-8 years.

If it is a sedan, yes, $500 is right for something they just want to dump. You should be able to easily ask $2995 and probably have people falling all over themselves to buy it from you. If you fixed it up and detailed it, you could ask $3995. Personally, I'd probably just vacuum it, throw a bucket of water over it, and let the first $2500 cash take it away as is. Be honest with the ad and list its needs and that is why you are only asking $2995. I bet it goes quick anyway. I'd buy it. ","Hmm.

I'm not understanding what you are trying to say. Inflated trade-in values for a tax benefit?

With ""quattro"" AWD it is easy to use all of that power all of the time (as long as no one is directly in front of you). Rain or shine. Of course, since you get up to 60 MPH in 5 seconds, you won't be using it for all that long before you are coasting.

I like the power when I'm getting onto the freeway on-ramp, when I'm accelerating from a stop light where there is a green light or no more lights in front of me, and for accelerating out of a twisty hairpin turn to make sure the back end of the car stays buttoned down. I also like power when I'm in a sticky situation with other bad drivers, and I can just leave the scene quickly. I find power to be just as important as good brakes in many situations.","LOL ""other bad drivers""","
Yes, sometimes it is the plural form of driver around you.","

Yes, I realized it could be interpreted that way.

Given a choice, I am much more comfortable having a surplus of power, of the ability to accelerate my way out of a ""sticky situation"".

One of the reasons I don't have a CR-V. I came very very close to buying one about 3 years ago. Great for running around town, easy to park, comfortable. But ... out on the highway, you can NOT accelerate to get out of the pack and make that exit at the last minute. Ain't gonna happen. My F150, with the twin turbo V6, will absolutely ""scoot"" when you need it to.","That's one thing I like about my '15 Golf, it can move when it has to! Since it's usually only me in it 99% of the time, I tend to drive it a bit on the frisky side since I am on the expressway much of the time. Like last night going home, getting on the expressway, I was able to hit it and I was down the entrance ramp and on the roadway within mere seconds and get in before a pack of folks coming up behind me. Next thing I know, I'm at 75 without much effort. A big reason I'll probably keep this puppy longer than I originally thought...it does everything so well with excellent mpg's.

But don't turn it into work, please -- I did some checking on a fanboi forum. Oy vey -- not a bad engine per se -- by contemporary VAG standards -- but not without its little, uh, idiosyncracies. I don't think I'll have the stomach for it. Price seems way right, though.

I looked at it from the outside. Exhaust is very sooty, dunno if that's normal for these... it would be for, say, a Dodge truck but not for a Camry. Good looking car.

A friend of mine bought a car from him and I've talked to him a few times. He seems alright, his pricing can be very good or a little high, nothing extreme. He's got a 2004 Accord DX (no cruise!??) 5sp with 120k and a remarkably clean body. He's asking $3850 for it, which seems stiff but not unreasonable. Valve train is clean, so maintenance appears to have been done. New-ish ""Arizonian"" tires, so crappy and no excuse to buy good ones... oil seems low & dirty, which doesn't fit with the clean valves.. maybe it's using some.

Can't convince myself that any of this makes more sense than a cheap lease, though. The only reason I'd be interested in anything that old and miley is that I drive maybe 3k a year. So a new car is totally wasted on me, unless we make it the family runabout.

Which is what we're doing at the moment, but I'm 52 now and should I be riding my bicycle to work in this weather? I probably should as I don't get any other exercise...

Not necessarily. Mine is a 2003 and I've struggled to make it into a decent car. Right now, it looks great and everything works, and for $3800 you really can't have more fun for the buck. It's already fully depreciated, so you can't lose much if you don't like it and want to flip it.

Man, I don't think so. That would leave me with a really bad feeling about the car, and the way the last owner treated it.","
Yea. I may have to run from it. It was a lease and the guy jumped out of it after a year. That light tan headliner was just really dirty.

key to me, it drove great and is priced well. Trading out of the lease, that usually has nothing to do with the quality merits of the particular car. You can always have them pull the service/warranty records to verify it was taken care of, and does not have special needs.

Agreed, especially with the high gas prices in CA. Sister will drive it for now; she told me today she hopes the dealer will find her the RX within the next week or so. She's got a budget of $12K, which leads me to believe it, too, will have a lot of miles on it.

I've got my fingers crossed that these high mileage cars don't eat up a lot of money with repairs and maintenance.

I honestly don't know. 20% is my personal feeling about bad carfax reports. I have seen people get almost no deduction for previous accidents. It is an Audi, however, so I'd wager you will see some deduction of some sort. All you can do is try.","Some brands seem to suffer more from bad CARFAX than others. While it is true that as age and mileage increases, the value ""hit"" diminishes, I think 2014s are still sensitive to reports of damage.","

Same Car but a Touring Model instead of EX-L. White with Tan interior as well. It has 23000 miles though. CarFax and Autocheck is clean. Personal Lease vehicle. $24,500 before TT&L but includes all dealer fees.

Yes it is $1500 more than the EX-L but it is a Touring and it is 11 miles from my house where the other car is 200 miles away."
131,"Hey Q - I'm giving some serious thought to making this trade. Maybe you can give me a gut check that my numbers are decent:

Trade (in CO):

2016 Audi SQ5, Sepang Blue over Black leather.
Tech package, upgraded leather interior, wheel upgrade
13,000 miles
It's a CPO, though that probably doesn't matter from a trade perspective.

Purchase:

2015 BMW 428i xdrive Gran Coupe, White over red leather
M-sport line, Premium Pkg, Tech Pkg, Driver Assistance Pkg, heated seats
12,600 miles
CPO

I've been offered $48,000 trade on the Audi, and they're at a touch under $39,000 for the BMW, after several price reductions over the past month or two.

So that's a $9,000 difference (to my favor) - I'm offering $10,000.

Thoughts? Thanks in advance.","I like that BMW. If I was shopping in that price range, I would love one of those. Even though my wife would hate the interior color. Oh well!","I need some help on the bimmer. Is it an m sport model? The BMW designations these days make looking them up very difficult. And, fyi, Manheim does not separate GC from sedan, apparently.

also need to know the Audi trim level.

on a separate note, you have had that how long now? A couple of months?","Bimmer is an M-sport line.

Audi is a Premium Plus.

And on the separate note, it's been since July, so an entire 4 months! Sheesh!",Both numbers are very very strong. I see one bimmer at $36k but all others are $39k. Audi is a hair over $48k. So they are basically at auction numbers on both sides.,"Awesome - thanks for the info (and quick response as always).

So...the deal is strong; I just have to make the final decision if I really want to make the move, especially so soon after acquiring the Audi. As lighthearted as I make it sound, I do agonize over these quick decisions.

It's really more ""opportunistic"" than anything. The 4-series is on the ""list"" of those cars I'd want, and this one is in a color I like, equipped well, and has been sitting long enough that it's a good deal.","

Yeah, if I were to order one, I may hesitate on the coral red interior, but it's sort of freeing when you're buying used - you can be ""bold"" cause you don't have the choice anyway. I do think white is one of the only colors that works well with the red interior.

I do wonder if the red interior is one reason why it's sat for a while.","well, that red is certainly a love/hate option, so will do that","and based on the numbers, you would really be making a lateral move, apples to apples, so if you want to do it, go for it.","Yeah, since I like my current ride so well, the ""lateral"" nature of the move is the only reason it's compelling.",Am I wrong in my assumption that the SQ5 would blow the doors off the 428?,"I was discussing this with my son last night. His take was the Audi was ""better"" because it was going to be faster. Though real world, I doubt it is that much of a difference. Plus he is anxiously waiting for his A3 to come in, and desperately want an S3 instead!","
No - 349HP in the SQ5 vs. 240 (I think) for the GC.

I at least got to see the SQ5 - often, @breld trades out of them so fast I don't get to see them when we meet for the occasional lunch.","I thought the dealer's price was quite fair, if the car is in really good shape.","My sister has an appointment this afternoon at CarMax to look at the Navigator. She's hoping for $3K but will take anything over $2K to take it off her hands.

I guess she has a BIL with an extra vehicle they will borrow until they find a replacement for son #2.","
Well, I would've thought the same thing, and my expectation was that I wouldn't be all that wowed by it, but by the seat of the pants, the 428 feels quite fast.  Just looked up Car & Driver reviews - SQ5 was 5.2 to 60; 428i xdrive was 5.5.  

No doubt the supercharged V6 has an amazing feel and sound to it not matched by the 2.0t, but the actual performance differential is not as big as you'd be think.

Having said that, they called back and came up another few hundred from the already good numbers.  So I'm at the dealership making the trade.  Thanks Q for the pricing feedback - gave me more assurance on the deal.  

Now I'll switch over to chronic car buyers, accordingly.  ","Michaell said:

Gotta get together, soon.", I found a much bigger acceleration differential in my quick search. But whatever works. It is the feel that matters. ,"Was the SQ5 quicker in the reviews you found, or the 428 slower?  Or both?  Just curious.  ","son and I drove a 230i earlier this week, with same drivetrain. It moved. Quickly. Not sure how much more the 4 series weighs, but probably not enough to make that much difference.

and if nothing else, should get better MPG!","breld said:
Was the SQ5 quicker in the reviews you found, or the 428 slower?  Or both?  Just curious.  
R&T shows the 428 at 5.7 secs and MT shows the SQ5 at 4.8 and then 4.4 when broken in.","C&D shows 5.2 and 5.5 for the two vehicles, but that 5.2 just seems wrong for the SQ5.
I'd guess that R&T numbers are closer to real-world.","I know that Roadburner considers both to be dangerously slow, but to me, any of those numbers (and the cars in real world) are plenty fast! Not sure where you can even use 100% of the power on either one.","I will admit that after having the S4 and then the SQ5, I'm becoming a bit addicted to that power and acceleration. Not that the 428i is slow by any means, but there is a different ""feel"" (for lack of better words) to how the car propels itself.

Not to mention the sound of the engine of the SQ5 was intoxicating.

Having said that, I very much appreciate the efficiency of the BMW 4 cylinder, and the fun of pushing it more to its limits to quickly accelerate - and it makes good sounds too, just not as nice as the SQ5.",I give it 3 weeks.,"
Here are my dividing lines:

Slow: Over 6.5 seconds 0-60, over 15.0 seconds in the 1/4-mile
Average: 4.0-6.5 seconds 0-60, 12.6-15.0 seconds in the 1/4-mile
Fast: Under 4.0 seconds 0-60, under 12.5 seconds in the 1/4-mile

For what it's worth, three cars in my garage are slow- and two are average...","Wow! I would think anything with a ""4"" in front of it would be fast, but just gets edged out for average in your dividing lines!

Naturally, how fast a car is is but one measure of it's fun to drive score - the 318ti in your fleet being a great example of that, huh?","
That's my thinking - how much of the performance can you use regularly?

Went to pick up dinner tonight and decided to floor the Jetta from a light. Couldn't tell you the time from 0-60, but it felt quick enough through the butt-ometer.","
Sure, straight line performance is just one factor. The nice thing about the ti is you have to keep the motor within its relatively narrow power band to make any semblance of rapid progress.
My point is that the horsepower wars have scrambled the categories quite a bit; back in 1994 my Dinan-chipped M6 was seldom bested at the Stoplight Grand Prix- and it could barely break into the mid-fourteens in the 1/4 mile. Today that's nothing. You could argue that a 0-60 under 4.5 second and a 1/4-mile ET of under 13 seconds is fast and I wouldn't take much issue with you, but there are a LOT of cars that would then fall into that category."

It's difficult with the extremely low miles but sometimes dealers treat low miles like gold when they are more like maybe silver or brass.

My SWAG would be about $7,500 dealer retail. The dealer may have paid a lot to get it, don't know. As they say ""the profit is in the buy, not the sell"", so they may be into it rather deep.

If you had to have it and decided to be as generous as the law allows, then maybe $8K---but at that price, don't expect to recoup that as the miles go up.

Yes, that's the part of the equation that needs to be considered. This is not going to be on the dealer's front line, and probably not on his back lot either. So he's looking at this as a car he doesn't want and has to exert time and money to get rid of.

Not that you asked, but with the miles you apparently drive, I strongly suggest buying used. Find an older model with low miles to balance out what you will put on. I am in this boat myself by driving 20k-25k a year. So I am looking to pick up a luxo model at least 4 years but with as few miles on it as I can find. By the time I am done with it in 2-3 years, it will probably then have near average miles for its age and will only cost me maybe $10k-$15k in depreciation.","Q, I am in the opposite situation. Now, I drive so little, I am better off finding a higher miles for it's age unit like that BMW, and buy it for a good discount because of that, and end up at average miles just coming from the other direction.","definitely the smart move, as long as it has been well taken care of.","Another way to look at the ""depreciation"" is to realize that MSRP is hopelessly inflated. Mercedes plays the same game; few people ""buy"" their C or even E class cars new, they lease them. So it's all about the payment, which it is nine times out of ten in any case. It's better for the brand to offer subsidized leases than (cough, American trucks) huge cash rebates.
Though, as pickup trucks show, you can have big rebates AND big profits at the same time. But you can't have 'luxury.'

Remember when the big SUVs came out? The Tahoe in the late 90s? At first, they had ridiculously strong resale, as there was no supply of used vehicles. After production ramped up, this normalized, of course. Banks got into the leasing game in a big way and wrote all sorts of crazy residuals into the contracts... because, hey, we have today's auction numbers, amiright? They lost thousands a unit when the trucks were returned. This was totally predictable, but you don't send an MBA with a spreadsheet to a knife fight.

Banks are by and large out of leasing now except for the captive houses.

That Q5? No idea. Units with 30k'ish miles are $33k on average. I'd guesstimate a good $3k-$3500 hit for the excess miles on this one, putting it at just under that $30k mark, so the price is surprisingly fair enough.","

No hurry on these.. they are hypothetical cars, not real ones.
I have a chance to hitch a ride down south next month -- and a ride back a few days later, if needed -- and I'm contemplating a little car-buying adventure in a rust-free area. Let's say Atlanta. Or Nashville.

I'm not looking for pristine, just for a nice keeper that won't rust out its brake lines after 12 years of life, like a lot of them do here.

My two favorite candidates:

2009 Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan both engines/transmissions
2006 Dodge Caravan/Chrysler T&C [short wheelbase]
2009 Dodge Grand Caravan/Chrysler T&C [new body style; proven drivetrain]

Up here in Michigan, the Fords appear to be good value and fairly rust-proof.
So for a long-term beater car, that might be it.

OTOH, I can't seem to find any worthwhile minivans. Either beat all to heck and dirty [most of them], or $5k for ten-year-old example with 150k miles. At which point a new one for a little over $20 becomes a better value.

Thanks in advance, as always!

@All: A philosophical question: Where in the rust-free states is the best place to go buy a car? The southwest, where everybody drives 100 miles for coffee? The east cost, with shorter miles and more stop-and-go? Florida, with its endless supply of 30k miles terminal Town Cars?
Are prices higher/lower anywhere in particular?

I have been to Atlanta. I flew out with my boss from Tucson in Oct. 2008 to attend some medical training there we needed to better serve our hospital in Willcox, AZ. Wow - Atlanta's traffic is silly-busy and we had to walk around downtown with our luggage late at night. We stayed at a Hilton Park Inn or something of that nature, but, being out-of-towners, we chose the wrong Park Hilton. We looked for the subway train we just got off of that we hopped on at the airport to get downtown, and couldn't find it. We were stuck temporarily on foot in downtown ATL! Man, I've never been hit up for money like that before anywhere, any time.

Funny thing is is that I read about it on the net before-hand that ATL had a nasty beggar problem going on. Apparently The City of Atlanta decided to try installing little ""beggar handout"" stands on city streets. No kidding - they're little grab stands where the city was going to dispense change for beggars so they'd leave people alone more downtown. I mean, Atlanta has Olympic Park, CNN Headquarters, Coca-Cola Heaquarters and one of the best aquariums I've ever seen anywhere - the Georgia Aquarium. Fantastic Titanic Exhibit there. I went to it even though I'd already been to one at The Seattle Center a few years earlier. Loved it again! The Hartfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta is one of the busiest in the nation. We eventually found our correct Hilton and travel was done accurately the rest of the week. If Charlotte, NC, is indeed further east than Atlanta is east, then Charlotte is the farthest location eastward in the U.S. that I've ever been.

Have you ever sold a $30K+ vehicle privately? Seems like slim pickings; though you can verify a cashier's check by calling the bank and they will verify if legit up to what amount. That is a high dollar transaction though to undertake with a stranger.

I had trouble selling even a Honda because it was well over 5 figures, although it was a 2-door Coupe. First person that finally came around and followed through with a test drive bought it, but that took months. Might have gone faster if I paid for advertisements (stuck the the free stuff for months). Finally I paid $60 for a spot on Autotrader until it sells (forever), and it sold 2 days later, and of course, they didn't find it on Autotrader, but on free Craigslist. Easiest $60 they ever made over there.

I didn't even bother trying with the accident damaged S4 recently.

That's what I like to do, only I use a credit union. If they see the teller at the credit union cut the cashier's check, they can rest easy that it is not a fake check.

Sometimes CarMax offers an insane amount for a used car. But then, they sell most of their used cars for what I consider to be an even more insane amount.","

36 is probably about right for them in this instance. If, for example, they bought at the top of my range at auction (35k), then had to pay the auction fees, transport, plus any unforeseen reconditioning because you can't inspect at an auction like you can when the car is driven onto your lot by a customer, they'd be into it for $36k or even more.","Wire transfer is the safest. You bring your title and a Fedex envelope to your bank officer. When the money is wired and appears in your bank account, it's REALLY there. And then the bank officer can drop the title in the mail. That puts you and your out of state buyer at ease. If it's an ""in person"" buyer, you can both go to your bank and do the deal however you are comfortable.","


Exactly.. when they see you procure the check from the teller at the bank, then no worries.

The only vehicles I've bought out of town from private sellers were cash deals. We still met at the bank to get the paperwork notarized.",Good luck doing that at an internet bank over your smart phone,"

My mechanic said that there's a market out there of kids that like VW products and mine looked particularly good in that blue color and the fancier rims.

When selling my vehicles privately / on Auto- trader, Cars.com , Craigslist etc. If your selling a vehicle @15k, 20k,30k, 40k and other buyer has not been Pre-approved , Approved or telling you COD they do not get to look/ test drive my vehicle.

I'm not sure how the packages work. Most I have found say they are just SLT. I do want leather, power, heated seats.

The only other alternatives are cash, if someone from out of state wants to carry that much with them, or a cashier's check, which can be forged, and your bank may not be able to detect this in time.

Anyway, I took it to toyota and they told me $6000 but few days later he refused to buy it because I am not buying car from them. Infinity offered me $4500 for it several other dealers at similar price. Am I getting ripped off here? I looked it up on kbb, edmunds and they both estimated my car value at $4500 + $1500-$1700 on mileage so total value were $6000+. Dealer trade-in prices were basically general price and they don't factor in mileage or they don't care about my low mileage. Should I even sell my car at $4500 to dealer or should I use kbb online system? How does it work? even on fair setting which is worst setting on kbb car value, I get $5800. If I put my car info on kbb, do they tell me to take it to the dealer shop to get it appraised? I went to local suburban auto shop which had kbb sign inside, the guy told me they would pay me $4000, even lower than infinity.

yeah.. wish I could do that. i've been to few mechanics or shops but they told me they don't deal with power steel and exhaust problems or their quote was similar to acuras. I know I can get brake and tires a lot cheaper than acura's price so total price for repair would be $800 for exhaust and power steel leak from acura + whatever tire and brake cost. It would make total repair $1100 to $1200 I guess..I would want to get $7000+ for it if I were to do that but I don't think dealers will give me $7000 even if I fix the issue.

Very difficult to sell such an expensive vehicle privately. Most people need financing, for one thing. You are also letting any yahoo come and test drive your $35k vehicle. And, the big factor, depending where you live, you could get a tax credit on the trade. Taking a look at this vehicle, for example, if a dealer gives me $33k, I would also benefit from $2310 tax credit toward the vehicle I am buying. You add that to the cost of advertising and detailing the vehicle myself and all the hours I spend dealing with the inquiries and test drives, I MIGHT clear a few hundred bucks extra? No thanks.","Q... Good points taken. My view is this.. 35k is not a lot of money today for a good 1 yr old vehicle / serious buyer. Plus getting only 35k you may still be leaving another 2k on the table.

A good detail and ads at best is 300 dollars. If like you say your worried about people test driving your vehicle than by all means give it away . In 40 years of buying and selling private I never had a problem. But that's me","I am with Q. for cheaper cars, private is fine. but for newer expensive ones, very hard to do. Loans involved (on both ends), loss of tax credit, and small buyer pool are major impediments.

CarMax though could be an option for something this nice, since it sounds like a unit they would happily put on their overpriced lot!

Me, I would be looking to trade this in. Sure, can troll an ad out there just in case, but not expecting it to work.","
Right. $300 plus the $2300 tax credit is $2600 vs MAYBE $3k more selling it privately (and, BTW, good luck getting that since that would be damned close to fair retail transaction). I'm not taking that risk and wasting that much of my time for the slim chance of making $400 for my troubles. Far from what I'd call ""giving it away."" If anything, I'd be giving my time and trouble away by trying to sell myself.","Thanks @brian125 , @qbrozen , and @stickguy for your inputs.

Thanks again!","
I would expect CarMax to give you a price higher than what your dealer would offer.

Had that happen last year. Had a 2010 CX-7 we wanted to trade in on a 2015 Outback.

CarMax offered $12,500; Subaru dealer initially offered $10,500 - after I showed them the CarMax quote, they matched it. And, I got the tax benefit from that as well (8% of the $2K, or $160).","Good point @Michaell
Thanks!","mdx2050

I like Auto Traders screening selling service its well worth the upgrade $$ . If your Leary on scammers , shady buyers coming to test drive look into this service. Each potential buyers screened to make sure there legit have finance etc, then Auto Trader contacts you 1st with contact info. No one is allowed to call you.

My 2012 X-5 sold within 40 days. It was worth the $199 fee

Time of the year is important when selling certain vehicles.

2 yrs ago I wanted to sell maybe trade my 13, R-spec Genesis with 10k miles at the time figured might have trouble asking 34.5k and getting it. Trade in was 30k from MB dealer, Audi offered 31k. Within 2 weeks had my 1st serious buyer thru Auto Trader came looked, test drove agreed on my price but I declined to sell . Over the next 2 months ad ran had many inquirers to buy. Still have Genesis sits in my garage in Myrtle beach. Glad I never sold it .
Getting a CarMax price helps when dealers undersell your trade in. Your gonna see all the slimy dealers telling you 32k is the most they can give you. Run

If you leave your email info on my hm. page I'll ask around for you here in the NYC area.

Good luck","
Have you ever sold a $30K+ vehicle privately? Seems like slim pickings; though you can verify a cashier's check by calling the bank and they will verify if legit up to what amount. That is a high dollar transaction though to undertake with a stranger.

I had trouble selling even a Honda because it was well over 5 figures, although it was a 2-door Coupe. First person that finally came around and followed through with a test drive bought it, but that took months. Might have gone faster if I paid for advertisements (stuck the the free stuff for months). Finally I paid $60 for a spot on Autotrader until it sells (forever), and it sold 2 days later, and of course, they didn't find it on Autotrader, but on free Craigslist. Easiest $60 they ever made over there.

I didn't even bother trying with the accident damaged S4 recently. I imagine an S4 would attract more hooligans and joy riding test drivers than an Accord Coupe though."

Does not have a sunroof - basically the only option she did not get.

Car is in good shape - no accidents, dents, dings, scrapes - just little stuff here and there from 4 years of California highways.

Located in the Bay Area.

What do you think she is looking at on a trade? My guess is probably $8k-$9k?","oh, my, yeah. How in the world is she getting around in such an old clunker?

Pretty good guess on your part. That is about right, depending on how they feel about the missing moonroof.","
She likes the size. Her concern is that the transmission went out last year at 13k miles and the dealer all but told her she can expect it to it again at some point. She now commutes about 25 miles a day and is worried with it out of warranty its just a matter of time.","How is it out of warranty?

I believe her powertrain coverage is 5yr/60k","
I'll double check - Ford dealer told her if it goes again, it isn't covered.",sounds like she has a bad dealer.,"
Find me a good Ford dealer anywhere...","I don't keep my cars long enough to really get to know my dealers.

I believe I had my Mustang in for 1, maybe 2, oil changes, and that's it.","i won't have to worry. every time I show my wife one and tell her how nice it is, her response is always ""but it's a Ford""

I still am not sure why. She is the same way about Chevy's, and her Dad was always a Chevy guy when she was growing up.

I think she somehow became a badge snob.",The dealer does not decide the warranty coverage. The factory does.,"But on what planet would the factory deny coverage on a transmission failure with such low mileage and all proper maintenance? Particularly when one already grenaded..

EDIT: Regardless, she wants to keep the car but doesn't trust it, which is the primary problem. It has stranded her twice on the Bay Bridge.","I know that if a car did that to my wife, I would be told to make it go away (or drive it myself) because she is never driving it again. Actually might only take 1 instance, unless it was truly a fluke.

if your sis can afford it, really not a big deal if she is not going overboard on a replacement, so might as well do it for mental health reasons!","Oh, I agree. It is stressful to drive something you don't trust.","
I take the same approach, but both times were before the transmission was replaced. No issues so far again yet. I tend to agree with you, but ultimately her call.","Trying to see where we are in our lease.

2015 GMC Terrain SLT 1 All Wheel Drive V6 Engine
Silver with black leather interior
13,900 miles
Hudson Valley NY Region

Has the Open Road Package (power moonroof, navigation, power liftgate, collision warning, backup camera, keyless entry, satellite radio). Power windows, power door locks, AC.
Original tires (about 75% to 80% tread left). It has the 17"" tires and silver alloys.

Truck is extremely clean. Residual is $23,836. Our contract obligation with the remaining lease payments is about $27,250 per GM Financial. As much as I like the truck, I suspect we will be returning it to GM when the lease is up based on it's real world trade value. Thanks in advance.","with those miles right now, it is somewhere in the $24k-$25k range as a trade. Technically, right now, you could buy it out for the $27250 and have yourself a pretty fair deal.

On a personal note, everytime I see these trucks, I take notice. I really like the looks for some reason. My wife thinks I'm nuts.","
Hmmm... I took the ""what else could go wrong"" optimistic view the last time I drove an unreliable vehicle. After getting it fixed, I always figured ""what else could go wrong?,"" and didn't sweat it or stress about it. That is, of course, until it broke down either requiring another tow (leaving me stranded), or a high repair bill, then the stress would skyrocket again.

I suppose I've learned my lesson, I wouldn't probably wouldn't let any car leave me stranded for reasons other than a bad battery more than once.","I don't have a problem when things break, but if the same thing keeps breaking, that's when I don't want to even risk driving it.","I'm a little different. When I have a car where something NEW breaks every time, then I lose hope.","I used to drive old cars, with high miles. And I expected to have to walk occasionally. These days, no. If I don't trust it, it's gone. Life is too short, drive something you enjoy, something you trust.","
Thanks Q. I'm not as bad off as I thought. We really like the truck as well. It rides great, and we like the look a lot. But we thought the 4 cylinder was too underpowered for this truck when we leased it. Our dealer had to locate a 6 for us and swap it out. The 6 cylinder makes a huge difference.

I'm sure I'll check back in as we get closer to the lease end. We have about 9 months left.","Yes, I'm quite surprised that the majority of used ones I see on the market are 4-cyl. Kind of disappointing.","New car comes in in 3 weeks and need trade-in value and private party value because
We have someone that says they want the vehicle.
Haven't had dealer look at it yet but he said it should be Kelly Blue Book excellent which is about $14,200.

Want to sell it as is but I don't know what to ask. i don't want to trade it I want to sell it outright. Can anyone help?","
A couple of questions:

Where are you located?

AWD or FWD?

Color - inside and out?

That information will help our experts figure out the right price, but I imagine you'll get a pretty penny for it in a private sale.","Upstate New York - Central NY, AWD, Blue Outside/Black inside","Up in the northeast, that is a sub-$4k car at auction, so dealers are probably asking $7k-$8k and taking $6500. So detail it up and put new rubber on it, start at $6995, and accept the first $6k offer.","Catching up here, guys...

I sold the Outback to the Subaru dealer today for $19 even. Yeah, I don't get it either. I paid $21,400 for it plus $3,800 in ""Subaru bucks"" coupons, so I'm really happy. The used-car manager said it's a sought-after car with the motorhome crowd to use as a toad with 4 wheels down. Who knows; I took the check and ran.

No replacement yet; I need to get a new concrete driveway before the snow starts, so I'll hold off. Might get a cheap lease on a Chrysler minivan, might get an old beater, might get nothing. We still have the '03 Sienna [wife] and the '16 Cruze [daughter & I], and I don't really commute.

The key to the Crosstrek is to get the 5speed, like a friend of mine did.

Cheers -m","That's brilliant, Mathias! I thought Chase said those Subaru Bucks had no cash value.....

You definitely made the right move on that one. The timing was very good as well, given that owners (original or future) only have the option of buying an extended warranty if the car is still within the B2B period. That is probably not true of ""Certified"" vehicles.","Guys...
I'm in Denver and my wife is still fixated on a BMW X6. She specifically wants a 2014 35i that is certified. I have found a few outside of the region but I don't want to jump on planes multiple times to look at them.

Would it be worth my time/money to get a broker involved as I have never purchased one out-of-state and had to deal with the taxes, transportation, etc...or should I just negotiate via phone/email and take my chances?","My sister loves her 2015 CrossTrek and loves the mpg.

She's an lousy, inattentive driver, so an additional governor on the engine would be a plus. I'm really happy that I talked her out of a MINI.","
Well, you're right that you do, to some extent, ""take your chances"" when it comes to distance purchasing. But, as long as you do your homework (carfax, dealer reviews, known issues with the make/model, known history, etc.) and ask the questions that are important to you (particularly regarding the livability stuff such as smoking, pets, and whatnot), I think it is completely doable.

I just purchased my Passat from nearly 4,000 miles away, and I was absolutely comfortable with the transaction (which was literally sign & drive by the time I arrived there). The car was exactly as I expected and continues to be so a month later. While this is the fourth car I purchased from a distance (e.g., site unseen), it is the first used car, and I'm happy I took the chance.","You can also pay an inspector to give it a final look-over and test drive if you wish. Cost maybe $350, so maybe cheaper than a plane ticket and a refusal on your part if you don't like it when you get there.","
That was a driver in this case... I've done this before; when I buy new, I either (i) keep it forever, like the '03 Sienna that my wife can't bear to let go, or (ii) sell after less than a year because it doesn't work for me like the 07 Silverado that didn't fit into my garage.

Method (iii) is to sell it when it's become cheap, like my '07 Vibe that I sold in 2014 for $6k, and method (iv) is to sell before the warranty runs out. i've done that with a '98 Prizm, an '04 Vibe, and now the '14 Outback, and in every case, things worked out well. It seems that people have a lot more trust while the car is still under the B2B warranty.

The UC manager at Subaru/VW/Audi -- there ought be a law against cornering the AWD market like that -- did not even drive my car. He started it, checked for trouble lights, shifted through the gears, and called it good.

Heck, I went home to ditch the bike racks and spent 5 minutes locating the Allen wrench to adjust the OEM roof rack rails. The guy didn't even verify that the spare tire was present... felt like I had to do everything myself. Of course, maybe he's bought cars from OCD types before...

By comparaison, I'm fanatical about checking out used cars... I'm a big fan of old, sub-$5k jalopies with some miles on them... you can usually tell how they were treated, and if you make a mistake, oh well...

Cheers -m","on the BMW, depending on where it is, there are probably a few people here that would be happy to take a look (and test drive) for you!","
That is reassuring. It is a CPO car so I am hoping that it is in tip-top shape. Thanks!","

Basically, the nice daily driver beater. Will make putting extra sticky soft tires on the TTS make more sense, be less costly, more efficient use of the good rubber, and in general just make it a weekend and track toy. Maybe a day to work here and there when I need services.

That way I don't need to hassle with changing wheel/tire sets all the time, nor waste good rubber on a straight freeway stuck in rush hour slow mode.

I almost bought a '14 Accord Sport when they were new (Around $22K at the time). IF I had done that I'd of not bought an S4 and simply gone maybe stage 3 on the old A3 (it was already staged 2).

If money was no object I'd have an R8 LMS Ultra as the toy and an S4 as a ""beater."" Now that would be the good life.","depending on the miles you want to put on it, and how long it can keep your interest, might be a good situation for a cheap lease. An Accord or Civic could work, but probably not that cheap. A Jetta like I have or Michael, for barely $200 per month maybe.

the Accord Sports are nice cars. If the sleazeball dealer that we drove one at (that for some reason, had a ton of them) had not been crazy greedy (and had not skeeved my wife out) I might be driving one. Or more likely, my daughter would have one!","Yes they are nice.

I test drove the new '16 Kia Optima LX Turbo (1.6T) earlier today. Great car! 10X better than the LX FE model with the 2.4. More powerful, faster, quicker, more efficient (7-speed DUAL CLUTCH!), so the transmission is EVEN better than the already good 6-speed in the 2.4L. Costs about the same as the 2.4L! With a bit of time spent I think I got their supposed ""rock bottom"" number, about $20,700 with 250 back if you used 2.9% Kia Financing. Seems like a great price for the car, just not sure I want to spend that much. It would smoke the Passat's 1.8T.

Kia is going the right direction. Main flaw I found was no spare, but not a big deal to me.

VW Pasadena sent an email advertisement for a Passat S lease at $129/month for 10K miles with 1,999 down 20 cents each additional mile. Think there is any catch? Might be right as someone showed they might go down to $17,500 or so on the car.

I'd probably want 12K miles per year though, as currently with one car I'm between 15-20K/year. I think my 2nd car would have to be a mid-sizer, not a Jetta. Want something bigger than the TTS, for hauling people and stuff. Something that could hold the wife, me, the grandparents and the car seat all in one.","mid size is so competitive now, can get the bigger size for very little extra money. Though I do find the Jetta surprisingly roomy, the Passat is still huge. that price, no money down, would be in the $200 range, so about right.

On the Kia, if it is like the Hyundai (and it is basically the same car) the spare is an option on the cars where they don't make it standard.","
Wow, that is good to hear Q. It was end of the month, so maybe they really needed to the move the car I was buying. Took me a good 5hrs at the dealership, but I am happy with the deal. Thanks again for your help.","@stickguy ,

Which one (RT 73?)","
actually it was Burlington. At the time, Burns had none left, and Burlington had a bunch for some reason.

Never going there again.

Though it was worth going to Hamiliton instead. That was the place that offered the deal on a Civic Si that almost killed me to pass on.","Hey Q. Just curious, but what would a 2014 Lexus ES350 with 37K go for? Normal equipped with Navi, otherwise I think mostly basic. Saw one listed local for $26,700 and trying to get a feel for the market.","Ok, never been up there.

The ES will feel a little like a boat to you, light steering and soft ride. The Toyota 3.5 is one sweet engine, and I'm sure it is quick. My 06 Avalon for a barge moved really well.","$14k-$14.5K for a '16 Golf S with less miles than my '15 SE with just about 22k on the clock is very disappointing, thinking mine would probably be on the lower side even with the nicer rims on it. Very disappointing indeed, as I didn't think the depreciation was that steep on VW's. Be fore the Tucson, I'd always kept a vehicle at least three years, the '03 Sentra, and all others at least eight or more...depreciation never came into the picture. TheTucson did open my eyes a bit as I wasn't too pleased with the trade-in offers I got and now with the Golf's range, am totally disappointed. Just makes me think that keeping it for the long haul might be the path I end up taking if it doesn't have any issues. The more I drive the A3, the more I like the hatch on my Golf and the flexibility it gives.
So far, it's been super reliable except for the starter hiccup it had, and it's a hoot to drive. And liking the fact that I don't see one on every street corner plus the nice color combo, keeping it for the long haul looks better as time goes by. Luckily, found a good indie repair shop right down the street and they seem pretty knowledgable. Only way I'd want to keep it for the long run is to have a good mechanic near to keep me on the road while I'm still employed. Once I retire again, less of an issue.

The Sandman","
As others here have stated, if you're concerned with depreciation and resale value, there are 2 things to keep clearly in mind.

1) Make and model. Hyundai is definitely not known for resale value, rather the opposite. I don't think VW is as bad as Hyundai, but it is not close to the top, and I suspect they have taken a beating due to Dieselgate. Any Honda will hold it's value better than anything else you can buy (exception for Ford and Chevy pickups). And of course, there is Subaru, really ungodly resale value if you live in Colorado!

2) Getting a really good deal up front. And by that I don't mean hammering away at the dealer to save an extra $200, I'm talking about buying at the end of the model year, and picking one that is being pushed hard with extra incentives.

Now if you really want a VW or a Kia, and you want it NOW without waiting, then go right ahead. But don't be surprised at how much you're going to lose in a year or two if you decide to trade it in.","stickguy said:

Most are in the high $22k range with a few dogs going for $2k less","

Let me say that my '16 Golf was a great car. Fun to drive, economical (got 45mpg on my daily commute, regular gas), refined interior, great 1.8t engine and was solid on the highway. Definitely a great value for what you pay. I wasn't crazy about the 5sp MT and my wife never felt comfortable driving a stick with the kids in the back, so that motivated me to consider a replacement with an automatic trans.

So the only way I could pull an upgrade was like Heryn states, you get a killer deal upfront. I did my research and was able to get $5,600 off an outgoing 2016 GTI that they were clearing out because new 2017's were just arriving on the lot(plus dieselgate I guess helps). After we agreed on the final price I told them I had a trade and they obviously tried to low ball me and it was a long process to get up to 15k, but we got there and I pulled the trigger. Truthfully, at 14k I would have just kept it since my car had been super reliable and was super clean.

Another option is to consider selling it through Beepi, looks like a really great car selling service and their appraisals are way better than dealer trade in value. They offered to buy it for a bit more than 15k if the Golf didn't sell in 30 days. Not bad at all. Looks legit and my contact with them was very professional, check them out just to see what they say.","QB

Thanks!!!","Nope. Per the carfax, it never went to auction. Odd that it was titled, then offered for sale with 6k miles and now has 14k. I have to assume maybe the dealer has been driving it for the past 8k without titling it. Huh.",Might be a BMW company car.,Thanks QB! I bet that is probably what it is...the guy who has it now is a broker...,"speaking of interesting carfax, saw an interesting one today (a 2011 Lexus that popped up, actually from Carfax teaser). Had about 54K on it. Not bad. but it had sold earlier (about exactly a year) with 15K on it. so in one year, 2nd owner loaded on about 39,000 miles. That is a lot of driving in one year!","Understand all that, and buying at the start of the model year maybe wasn't the best plan but, it just happened spur of the moment. The wife just got herself a new Audi, I liked hers so much and since we had never ever thought about buying German, it kinda opened the door. Since her pocketbook is larger than mine, she pulled the trigger. After a few days, I started to want the same but my pocketbook, much smaller so looking at a VW was the logical choice. Twelve days later, I pulled the trigger. And the rest is history.
Really like the vehicle and best thing is to keep it at least three years which is the current plan. From the start of this whole episode, logic was not a part of the equation and I stated that from the start. I satisfied a want, definitely not a need, so I didn't let anything get in my way, but at this age, why the hell not! And I was also fortunate enough to be left a large enough bequest that spending the cash plus my trade-in was just a given and I thank G-d for that, that one of my folks loved me enough and decided to think of me down the road, a shame that the other parent did just the opposite!

This quote from qbrozengoes back to late February and concerns my 2014 Subaru Outback Premium 6MT with (now) 26,200 miles in no-sale blue.

I finally started to shop it around. One of the big Chevy dealers offered $18,200 for the car.

I'm surprised they went that high; I tried the Honda dealer also, and they coughed up a rather modest $15, at which point I'd rather keep it.

I'll see what the Subaru dealer says, and unless they offer more, it's going to Shaheen Chevrolet this evening. Subarus are strong, and selling a car with 6 months of b2b warranty left has worked well for me in the past.

Doesn't the Crosstrek have the 2.5L? Shouldn't be too bad on gas mileage.","I think it depends on how you drive it. It's a 2.0L engine and it's a dog---so yeah, if you are a light foot and not in a hurry and drive mixed city/hwy, you would get decent MPG.

Glad I asked. My wife has serious interest in that model due to its looks. I will steer her away as it is a LOT smaller than the Sportwagen, slower, and less fuel efficient.

We had 19"" wheels and tires on our 2010 CX-7. I worked hard to get the tire replacement cost under $1000.","
Just to confirm, was that a serious response as to what you think I would get? Because it's not out of line with what I was expecting. However, I can't help reading this with a tone that makes me question whether it really is an informed answer to a sincere request.","

@qbrozen gives as straight-forward of an answer as you'll get from anyone. He is very informed from what I've seen as I'm sure all here will vouch.

In fact, I trust his opinion enough that I offered his figure of $14,500 on that Accord discussed above. Sight unseen, but it is a CPO.","

I would assume it as a sincere response. The age/miles mean it won't have a high value for a dealer, and you're often better off doing a private party sale on vehicles like this.",OK.

This weekend I had to fight hard to get 15,000 trade in value on my 2016 Golf TSi S 4dr HB 5pd Manual (Blue/Black) with 14,950 miles, top shape. Did I do ok? This was in Southern California.",I'd say you did very well. $14k-$14.5k with an auto trans would be accurate. Manual? I'd have guessed $13k.,"
If I were looking for one, I would think that was a very fair deal. If / when I unload this TDI, I may very well be looking for a minivan, but not now, and if and when I do it will be a newer / lower mileage unit. But I think you can easily sell that one for $6k, maybe even $7k, and if it's in good condition, that will be a good deal for whomever buys it.","They haven't accepted my 14,500 offer on that Honda Accord Sport CVT.

148,"The Mini is an ""S"" and like the color combo, just not sure I like it better than I do the Golf. They are so similar and think the fit and finish and mpg's are better in the Golf than the Mini. This deal might not make much sense since it's really a lateral move. Going with the X1 or even a Tiguan seems to be the better solution since I do like the higher seating position, like it a lot.
The X1 is a bit longer than the Golf from what I've researched with the Tiguan being closer and would be a better fit for my shorter side of the garage. Will just have to go test them all again and think real hard about this. Logically, it might be best to wait till I retire again and then swap out the Golf since my miles/month will go down considerably.
Thanks though for your help. If I find a Tiguan later, will shoot you the figures to see at what price it could be done.

Mini will beat you up on bumps---stiff suspension, short wheelbase---not a comfort to aching backs.","Shifty, have you ever been in a Countryman? I'm wondering how that compares.","
Thank goodness for adjustable magnetic suspensions these days! The TTS does have a short wheel base yet is still livable as a daily driver in comfort mode.

The difference between Dynamic and Comfort is noticeable just from the butt test immediately. That being said, I think Audi should consider a middle setting allowing perhaps a greater delta between comfort and Dynamic.

Perhaps these 3 settings would do the trick:

- Comfort
- Dynamic or Normal
- Track/Race

Maybe even 4 settings by splitting normal and Dynamic; as long as they increase the delta from full soft and full hard.","
The original? My daughter drives one .. it rides pretty rough compared to my Elantra GT.","""Sensitive to minor issues"" is about right...lol! I like when everything is working as it should so yes, maybe a bit on the particular side. Like it as clean as possible but right now, with it raining on a daily basis, been letting Mother Nature do the washing. Try to get to the car wash at least every two weeks if possible. With the A3, it's been every other Saturday since the dealer is right on the outside of our development.
But thanks for the chuckle with the phrase ""sensitive to minor issues""...was quite funny!!

The Sandman","
Once every two weeks? I wash my two vehicles at least once a week, sometimes twice a week. Unless it's raining, which it currently is. I park outside, under a carport, and it gets very dusty here in the summertime (at least when it isn't raining). And in the spring, pollen can turn a car green (or yellowish green) overnight.

Heck, I wax nearly that often (once every two weeks). But I will admit to using a synthetic wax, which is very easy to apply and buff out.","The notion of a car as an art object is lost on me. I drive my vehicles, and I enjoy that experience. Different strokes. . .","I wash when they really need it. Certainly not happening every 2 weeks. And I am lucky if I keep up with my 2x yearly wax jobs (once seems to do the trick too). Especially on the lease cars. They have both been done once, I think.

the water still beads on the RDX, so I must have done that one somewhere in the spring/summer. I did a bunch in one week when they were all home, so I started to lose track.","
Mini will beat you up on bumps---stiff suspension, short wheelbase---not a comfort to aching backs.

Yes, I have. It's better than the earlier cars and the longer wheelbase helps, but compared to say most $30K range sedans, it's still rough.","Now that I'm not living in the country, a wash every two weeks keeps the Encore pretty sparkling. We take it to a local car wash, which has the effect of making us clean out the interior and the hatch too. Of course we could do this anyway but somehow I seem to need the push of an actual appointment. Same reason I go to a personal trainer instead of just going to the gym.

Yes, cars are meant to be driven the way they are meant to be driven. I think some of that ""shock and surprise"" at tracking a trackable"" car stems from the Big 3 making cars that would self destruct if you took them over 3K RPM.

I know I know... that was then, this is now. I will say the Maserati someone tried to track didn't last more than about 2 laps one weekend at an HPDE. Those might be more for looking at and puttering around in than true performance driving.","what maserati was it? I've seen some interesting cars at the track. My first HPDE was in a G35X. People laughed until they had to give me the point-by. ""I never saw somebody hustle a limo around like that!""","
Well, it was a Quattroporte, looked brand new or close to it, and this was a few years ago. So according to Edmunds that would either make it a '14 or a '12 at the oldest.

I think it was probably just a bad coolant hose from the factory, but even so, the closest servicing dealer was in Beverly Hills, at least 100 miles away.",Depends how hard you push it at the track and for how long. Every showroom sedan has its limits.,"Every vehicle has its limits, showroom or not. ;b","
Yes, but you can limp home with self-destructed brakes, burned brake fluid, and shot to the cord tires. You can't make it home with no coolant or a severely leaking coolant system. I know if there's some slack you can cut and reattach, but I guess this wasn't one of those scenarios where it was just a bad attachment fitting.

That's the key to my definition of reliability and dependability, I want to be able to drive the snot out of the car for eight 20-30 minutes sessions in a 2 day weekend, and still make it home; even if it does throw a code; that's acceptable. If it can't get you home, that's unacceptable.

Granted, some of the people with older Audi's and BMW's have nearly a whole rolling mobile garage and auto repair shop going with them to the track, including an inventory of replacement parts. The price of owning an old car I guess.","Just become good friends with one of those guys.

Think I only have 13 payments left at this juncture. Our son went to Cricket wireless in Chicago so now, we're down to a 4 phone contract.
The iPhone is super expensive to be honest, I know my oldest went to a pawn shop with her iPhone 4 and they gave her a decent amount towards it. Found a guy who wants to sell me his iPhone 6 for $350 but haven't jumped yet as just not sure. Oldest said she'd sell me her ""5"" for a great deal if her sister doesn't take it from her but not sure I want old tech either, want new. And not sure if I really want to leave android. Really want a phone with more than 8 gigs of memory on the phone, want at least 16. A lady at the AT&T store showed me a way to go into a few of the app's I had through the internet thus freeing up space in the memory...just get on through yahoo.com. Also uses less power that way. Found that not every app is moveable over to a s d card, the majority of them are not.
Get a decent discount with AT&T due to being a postal service person and not sure if Cricket wireless does the same thing. I will find out before I do something. But think I'm ready to become an apple person to go along with my laptop, also an apple product. My old p c desktop is basically dead and need to clean my old stuff out and dump the cpu.

The Sandman",Buy a new iPhone and stop torturing yourself! I keep mine 3-4 years si I don't mind springing for a new one every now and then.,"
I have a corporate rate with 20 GB of data. It's pretty cost-efficient with three phone lines. If I were a single user, there is no way I'd stick with AT&T or Verizon.

Our old carrier sold out to Verizon, but their phones/network were compatible with AT&T. That's really why we chose one over the other. Only had to buy one new phone. If we went to Verizon, we would have had to buy three of them. Had the same rate deal there, but three iPhones? shewwww

We've been pretty lucky. My wife's phone is over two years old. Mine, which I inherited from my son is nearly three years old, and his iPhone 6+ is almost two years old. With that kind of longevity, we'll just keep buying, I think.","my 5 is at least 2.5 years at this point. and the wife's about 2? she has a 6. both are fine for now. the daughter, she chews through phones (college students live on them)","iPhone 6 for the wife and I through Sprint

This is a 4-door hatch, yes? Sorry, but try $14k.",I was thinking $15k. I was close!,"
If your tires are 25% worn after 20K miles you definitely don't need a sway bar upgrade. Sway bar upgrades are for people that need new tires after 12-20K miles.

You Vdub will be fine. If you know a good independent VW mechanic who is both honest and competent (admittedly a rare find to get one with both of those traits), then you are in a good situation.","There is a shop right down the street I stopped into to talk about the sway bar. Guy seemed to know what he was talking about so we'll see after I go off warranty. Prepaid the 30K service also so come the 40K one, I'll be free to go where I choose. And luckily, I do trust my own guy to point me in the right direction if he can't do certain things.
Bummer about the $14K price but am just not ready to flip it at this point. Just not the intelligent thing to do especially with a depreciating asset. As long as my commute is as long as it is, might as well keep what I got.
The local Hertz HLE still hasn't contacted me so not holding my breath. Saw the ad from that dental lab I applied at a couple years back on Craigslist so shot over my resume again just to see what happens. A lot closer to our house, similar hours/week with maybe$.30 more/hour. Would drive their vehicle taking and picking up dental stuff. Could be fun. The VW store has my latest application as to be honest, that's where I'd love to work. But all the folks they hire to be drivers are all older guys than myself, everyone I've seen doing it looks closer to 70 or close.

The Sandman","
Sounds like you just don't have enough life experience! Call them back in ten years.",You can always buy a Hollywood make-up kit. That's what I use to appear this age (I was tired of getting hit on all the time....),"Local dental supply store where I interviewed back in 2013 has an ad in Craigslist again so shot over an email/resume and meeting the owner there on Monday morning at 7:30. Reminded him that he turned me down before but he said come in anyways to talk. Much much closer to the house, use their small CUV an would be an employee and not an I C. Seems like it's a 5 day a week morning gig so will need to inquire further about this. Love the 3 on/4 off but the almost 10 hour days are getting to me as is the 60 mile round trip commute plus the tolls.
Figured might as well go talk with him again and see what's up. Nothing says he's going to offer me the gig once he sees me walk in with my cane so we'll just wait and see. Would be nice to get closer to $9.00/hr. or higher as am making $8.30/hr. now at Hertz. As much as I love Hertz, part of me is looking for a change after over 27 months.

Drive it and see if you like the non-sport seats. I don't find them comfortable or supportive but to each his/her own...","
I was under the impression (the distinct impression, based only on your comments here, over the years), that the job at Hertz was ""the perfect job for me"" because it allowed you to drive many, many different cars. Only driving one car would be ... quite different. Not at all what you're doing now.","Still love my Hertz gig but this job just came up again, had applied back in early 2013 but they went with someone else. What I'm getting tired of is the commute down to my Hertz location and the local branch hasn't acted on my transfer, seems they have enough folks at that location. Also, there's nothing saying I'm going to be offered the position tomorrow morning either. Figured might as well see what it's all about and go from there. If the numbers work out, mean the days /week and hours each day plus the salary, might be the better gig. It's only about 5 miles from the house down one main boulevard so there's be no more tolls and larger petrol bills.
Doubt I'll take it but just want to see what's out there. Just wish I could get a local transfer with Hertz, at least a location with 10 miles of the house. Honestly, I'd love to retire again, this time for good! I'm tired all the time and still in pain 24/7/365...many days worse than others. Luckily I've hardly ever called out sick and have only left twice because of the pain.

Knowing that they car that had a major accident repair can just be handed back like a perfect one, is nice to know!","I'll ask the the used car manager at the dealer where I drop it off for repairs, what the trade in value is after the repairs. The repair estimate from my insurance company is a little bit under $3000.","
I think age and type of car are factors as well. I think MORE buyers will care when it is a luxury or sports car, and MORE buyers will care if it is relatively new, vs. 5 years old or more. The diminished value is certainly reduced on a bumper cover when the car is older and more used up. On a brand new car I don't want my bumper fasteners and clips touched! too much potential for breakage and damage during uninstall and reinstall. Also ""lost"" clips can be an issue. Of course, with cars these days some common repairs not related to accidents require removing the face of the car.","Can you help me with a trade in value for a 2016 VW Golf Tsi S trim, 4 Dr MT. 10k Miles, zero damage, San Diego CA.

Friend wants to settle estate and sell a vehicle to a relative at a ""fair"" price that will satisfy other relatives that no unusual ""deals"" were made.

Vehicle is:

2012 Ford Escape Hybrid, AWD, auto., usual basic options, not a limited, no leather, no nav. Car is in San Francisco area, miles are approx. 60,000. Condition is ""fair"", clean CARFAX, 2 owners.

Car has DAMAGE, which always make things harder.

r/r door -- long deep crease, door length + peach size dent up top
r/f door -- short continuation of crease from r/r door
r/f fender -- small fist size dent
rear bumper -- paint peeling in spots, tweaked a little at seam
l/f fender --small fist size dent
Interior -- intact but stained cloth seats and headliner
Engine-- runs well, engine bay dusty and unkempt.

No structural damage was noted--this is all sheet metal.

My reasoning on this is $21-$23K dealer retail/ $12K-$14K dealer wholesale.

So, to sell to a relative without any drama from the siblings, what price?

I was guessing about $15,000. Seems to me that's a pretty fair discount for bodywork.

I can post some photos if needed.

Thanks!

Shifty",I think I would leave the relative out. I know people who don't speak to other family members over the inheritance of a Model A pickup truck. Risky at best.,"man, no way I would pay close to 15K for that based on the miles and description of being a beat up, not cared for, rat.

seems like a better idea is to shop it at a couple of places for a buy bid (carmax, a ford dealer, local lot) and get a real idea that way. and let the relative pay the best of those, and if they don't want it, sell it off.","
I agree, a fairly new car that has been beat up like that is just a huge red flag in my book. I don't know if I'd even pay $10k.","Yikes. Well, let's see...I can get a clean one at auction for $14k. So we have one that needs a few grand in bodywork. Gotta be $9k-$10k at the block and $12k-$13k retail. $11k sounds pretty fair as a private party deal.","OK! Good info guys, thanks. I was seeing some pretty strong dealer ""asking"" prices for a 2012 out here in California, but I can see that, regardless of that, I'm $3K-$4K too high.

I'm not sure how cars end up like this---this car must have cost what? $32K when new?

I think the family just has one person who is interested, so they want to make sure the estate isn't short-changed in any way. I can understand that, and the executor does have a responsibility to act fairly.","
Got a Carmax, nearby? Have them take it there for a quote. Then, sell it to the buyer for $500 more.","That's a good idea. I bet they hit it pretty low. I guess sometimes my "" car flipper"" mind comes into play, and when I look at a neglected vehicle I'm already thinking of clever and inexpensive ways to 'bring the car back""---you know, clean the engine with parts brush and Simple Green, rent a machine to shampoo the interior, and work with my body shop buddies on the damage. Shouldn't be too hard a color to ""blend""--steel blue.

Sweat equity so to speak. Buy for $10K, and if it turns out really nice, turn it for $17K.

but I'm pretty much done flippin' cars, so let someone else have all the fun.

Inattentive driver on the phone!! ( Both times.) First guy had some small insurance. They were a pain to work with. Repairs took almost a month.","
15% is a good rule of thumb for diminished value.","Yep, the accident is on CARFAX as rear end damage, says no air bag deployment, no structural damage---so it's not as bad as it could have been.","
Ouch! I hope nobody was injured","
Wow. Seems quite harsh. Is that per accident. So 30k and minus the 15% we re looking at roughly 25-26K? (","

Yup. It was a pretty hard hit but yeah No airbags were deployed.

I wonder when carfax starts reporting structural damage. My other car was involved in a side impact. No airbag was deployed. It had to be towed. I expected onstar to contact emergency services. It didnt. The reps told me the impact was not hard enough to activate the sensors. I wonder if that shows on carfax as structural damage. 1G1PE5SB3G7141439.","Man, you need to get those giant magnets out of your doors!

Yes, CARFAX says

""Accident reported
Involving right side impact
Vehicle towed
Front airbag deployed""","
Multiple accidents doesn't make any difference as the damage is already done and completed with the first accident, unless of course the second accident affects an entirely different area AND was significantly more severe than the first.

The diminished value takes into account the real diminished (the fact that body shops generally suck compared to factory workers and robots), and perceived diminished (the fact people know dealing with accident damaged cars can be a pain in the rear). Also, with a significant collision, the frame/body is weakened/fatigued, and therefore not quite as safe, and therefore not certifiable ""used"" any longer (with major rear-end damage). Due to being unable to be certified for used sale, it loses value on the market.

This is why you need to sue the at-fault parties for diminished value when accidents happen as insurance companies don't mind (are all too happy) leaving you to pay the tab for their insured's recklessness, negligence, and incompetence.","


How late can I sue. I mean one of the accidents was last year. The other was couple of months ago. I didnt know better at that time. And is it even possible to do so on a lease. I mean technically audi financial owns the car.","

Thanks. Yup. Haha.","
I think you are within any State's statue of limitation time-wise, though if you agreed to a settlement and took the money you likely signed your rights (on a release) away already (settled the claim)? As to going after this on a lease, I think that might be a roadblock. Just turn it in at the end of the lease and you suffer no loss. I think this is one of the big advantages of leasing; though I bet your replacement rental car was far inferior to a 3.0L Supercharged Audi A6!",I did settle both claims. Yes and no. The first time was a fiasco. I was never contacted by their adjustor. Car sat in my garage for a week. They never gave a rental. I had to demand it and was given a corolla. The second time it was state farm i believe. They asked me my choice of rental company. I picked the local enterprise which put me in a 2016 GMC Yukon Denali for no charge. It was a welcome change. I never drove such a big suv/truck before. I wasnt complaining.,"I rather doubt (but am not sure) that you could argue successfully a diminished value claim on a vehicle that already had a previous accident, since the first accident had already diminished its value.","
From my experience, that is absolutely true... except in situations where the damage from the current event was to a previously-undamaged area of the vehicle.","If it is a lease, then you are covered. Hand it back and walk away.","
Not only that, but it would be a very steep hill to climb. You'd have to show the first accident was minor and didn't diminish value in a significant way, but the second one did because it was more severe and damaged structural components; that's the key; ""frame"" damage is killer on lossed value.","Yep, frame damage or major panel replacements (i.e., welding, cutting, etc).","









I asked him if the appraiser looked like he was high - that's how off the wall I think that number is. 

Nope, I hate to say I told you so! But, I predicted the $6,500 offer from Carmax based on the following:

1) Carmax loves Hondas, and loves Civics in particular.
2) They will turn around and sell it quickly; probably in CA for $10,500.
3) We sold our '07 Civic about a year ago for $8,000 to Carmax,, and I adjusted down for your extra year of age and I forget what the mileage adjustment was but that's how I came to $6,500 (plus it's a year later).
4) So my year old data couldn't be too far off (ours was clean/very good condition).

I'd probably match Carmax's offer on a nicely kept/maintained Civic! However, I don't want to pay their asking prices.


A lot of people don't realize this but high demand cars that are in excellent condition like Civics and Corollas will break the bank at auctions. Our used car buyers would have to pay well over book values to be the successful bidder. Then we would have to pay transportation, pay our detailer and who knows what the used
car inspection would reveal? By the time they were ready for our lot we would often be in them for RETAIL

Given the situation with the Infiniti, I've kindly informed her it may be tough to roll the negative equity into a used car loan. Easier to do with a new car purchase or lease.

I get what she's trying to do - lower the cash flow by trading out of the Infiniti and into something less expensive.

Later this year, she wants to sell her Navigator outright when son #2 gets his license in October, use the proceeds to get him a used Tacoma (purchased outright), and then lease something relatively inexpensive (Mazda 3?) for her husband.

Sucks having kids who start to drive and want / need their own vehicle.

And, she's got one more son who turns 13 this year, so she's not done yet.","Wondering if I can get some clarity on a subject...

I leased a 2015 c300 back in Feb. The negotiated sales price was around $34,100. My payments are $311/month.

Lets say I wanted to trade this car in or sell it private party. My current Payoff Amount is around $38,700. Buyout will be $28k when the lease ends (36 month)

At what point would it be beneficial for me to look at a trade in or selling? I'm guessing I am too early in my lease to make a move, but what about a year from now? Will I have positive equity in this vehicle at any point?","
I'll let the experts weigh in with the numbers, but it's not easy to trade out of a lease. They are set up to keep you in the car for the entire lease term, with the intention of getting you to lease another car.

That said, your car has a payoff value - call MBFS for the current number. Then, compare that with the trade value you'll get here. Check back every 6 months or so to see if you get 'right side up' at any point.",A used Tacoma? Terrible idea the way they don't depreciate. Plus they are lousy!,"
Yes, way too early. I mean, think about it: you negotiated a $34k sale price, then drove away, so, without even looking it up, I could guess that the car couldn't possibly be worth more than $30k, and probably even far less than that. If you have a $38.7k buyout now, that means you are $9k in the hole.

Will it ever have positive equity? Nobody can tell you that with certainty.","
So really, my negotiated sales price doesnt mean squat, other than securing me a low monthly payment?","Pretty much. The buyout (residual) is the same regardless of what cap cost you ended up with.

I would be happy though to have a new style C class for $311 though!

Just curious, why looking to bail after 3 months?","
I'm not looking to bail. I think the car is great.

I like to stay informed on things like this and know what my options are.","
That is always the problem with a lease. You owe the payments no matter what. It is not like a finance where you are paying down the principal and the interest is accrued monthly. On a lease, the interest is all accrued right at the beginning, which is why your buyout is currently so much higher than your cap cost.",Usually the earliest you can get out is past half way through.

Shopped the Odyssey and the RX around a bit. One dealer the RX at 13 and the other at 11. The dealer at 13 also hit the Odyssey at 4500. Was real happy with the trade and the number on the new car so didn't even argue about price. Just said OK. Without seeing the Odyssey the dealer at 11 said best case at 15 and worst case at 14500. Once the deal is finalized I will swing back around and give everyone the details.

doubtful. It is a pretty solid $16k at auction, with some even going above that.","

That's a tough question to answer. On the one hand, if notation appears on CARFAX, then one would be tempted to treat it just like an Accident record; on the other hand, it wasn't an accident and so the integrity of the car has not been potentially compromised.

I think the selling price would depend on the type of car, and on the degree of information you could provide to the buyer.

In the back of my mind is always this thought: ""So, they couldn't fix the problem after repeated attempts, and bought the car back, and now suddenly it's fixed?""",Kinda like a certain Cadillac we know about ...,"

Correct on the branded title. Their blog says some states don't have title branding so you may have a clean title but carfax and auto check will show the branding...","Funny business about that “salvage title”. There are probably people here who are experts on the subject, having been in the car business for many years. But I will add my 2 cents worth.

I think the absolute worst is a car that has been flooded, and the insurance company has totaled it. There’s no way I would touch such a car. And the same would be true for one that was handled under the lemon law.

The majority of salvage titled cars that I have encountered have been totaled by an insurance company due to damage in a wreck. And you have to know what you’re doing, and have a really good idea of how much damage was actually done. There are people here in my area who make a living at this. They buy cars from the insurance companies, fix them (using junk yard parts rather than new), and then resell them. They usually have rather detailed pictures showing you exactly what the car looked like BEFORE they started working on it, so you can judge for yourself how severe the damage actually was.

I actually bought one used car from that path, and had no problems.

Probably the best path for a salvage title is a theft recovery. The car is stolen, and then later found somewhere stripped. Wheels and tires, seats, stereo, maybe more. The insurance company pays off, sells the car at auction, and someone “refurbishes” it with a salvage title. A good friend of mine purchased a very nice 2 year old Silverado for about 60 cents on the dollar that way.","Safer with cheaper cars too. Would think.

 Sorry I missed that. My sister lives in San Diego.  North county","Yeah, it *might* last ""forever,"" but then, it might not. All of the Toyotas that my family had required a fair bit of maintenance work in the upper 100Ks, including ball joints, tie rod ends, bushings, some wheel bearings, etc. One needed a transmission at about 200K (although, to be fair, I think that my SIL was kinda hard on it for such a high-mileage car). Depending on the recent maintenance log, you may have some $ in your future here.","Oh you mean where I say that a 75 year old man who takes great care of himself is more like to survive a full round of tennis than a 35 year old junkie? Well that's true---maintenance history is a factor when choosing a high mileage car over a lower mileage one that might have been neglected. However, expendables are expendables, such as tires and brakes, and some expensive components don't respond to maintenance, like alternators and struts and CV joints and suspension bushings----they deteriorate after many miles even in the hands of the most loving owners.","
My sister sent me some KBB info -

Infiniti is priced at $15-17K on trade

Lexus is priced at $12.7-$14.6 on trade; therefore, a retail price of $11K would look to be pretty solid.","I sometimes wonder where KBB gets their numbers.

Huh, my bad.

But, she hasn't done anything yet. I told her to check Edmunds and Intellichoice as well for numbers.","So it is just a base G37? Not a Journey or Premium or something like that? If not, then $12k is about the number.

Something is really really off with this Lexus. Most with miles like that average about $6k. Even if I took the most expensive one with 138k that got $7600, I could not pay more than $10k for it. But why in the world would she?? For the same money, I could get one with just under 100k on it.","
Yeah, but this is Southern California.

I'll pass this along to my sister.

Given the situation with the Infiniti, I've kindly informed her it may be tough to roll the negative equity into a used car loan. Easier to do with a new car purchase or lease.

I get what she's trying to do - lower the cash flow by trading out of the Infiniti and into something less expensive.

Later this year, she wants to sell her Navigator outright when son #2 gets his license in October, use the proceeds to get him a used Tacoma (purchased outright), and then lease something relatively inexpensive (Mazda 3?) for her husband.

At the time, it was hard to pass up the incentives on a new Miata, and you wouldn't think it, but the Mazda had a bit more legroom than the Honda.

Definitely a fun and ""pure"" car. I doubt used prices have changed all that much since I was looking a few years ago!","
That's barely broken in on a Honda!","KBB value promotion at my local Audi dealer this weekend, just got the S4 appraised at $30,805. Good, but not as high as I was expecting when I ran the numbers and options on KBB myself a week ago.

Kind of like the fake buy 3 tires get one free promotions where prices are jacked up to compensate for the free tire.

Just make sure the oil, filters, timing belt, & water pump are up to date.  Plugs should be good to 105 K miles like my Prelude.  I'm not sure how many engine parts it shares with my car, but I can tell you that at 156K, the motor still pulls strong all the way up to its 7400 RPM redline.  Good luck!  The S2K is a sharp car that I have always admired.",Wow.. I had no idea an S2000 was bringing that kind of money.,"Well, I definitely have a lot of ""Honda Fanboy"" in me too! Just getting harder and harder to get something these days that fuels that fanboy-ism...in good shape anyway.

Have to go back to what, '01, for a Prelude? TSX was still offered with the manual 'til its end though in decreasing quantities. The Civic Si mostly fits the bill, and I do look forward to the reveal of the new model as well as the Type R. And of course the S2000 is the quintessential high-revving Honda example. Given the price of these nice used examples, I have a hard time not thinking about the new Miata.

@qbrozen - 6' 5""! I thought I had issues fitting into cars. I did find the Z4 incredibly roomy for the class.

From what I can remember, it's been serviced in CT, OH, GA, IN, and WI.","Did love my '06 Civic and probably was dumb to trade out of it when I did but the combination of being bored, a new part time gig and a small inheritance gift drove me to do it.

It's not good enough to make me give up my Golf for it but it is on my short list for my kid in a couple of years from now.
Also really like the HR-V and sat in a leather lined EX-L today also. Not crazy about the knobless infotainment and HVAC systems, an o k idea done badly in my opinion. Somethings in a vehicle need knobs for safety reasons and these two are definitely it...could be a potential safety issue when one is using their fingers to change stations or fix the blower speed while taking one's eyes off the road for a few seconds. A good idea executed poorly is what I'm trying to say here. Do like the size of the HR-V and the seats were very comfy with decent views out of all the windows. Can definitely see Honda fixing this faux pas maybe as early as the mid year refresh as this vehicle is also appealing to folks in their sixties like myself, folks who want a crossover which isn't too big or too thirsty. To be honest, if not for the Golf, think I'd have this little Honda in the garage, that or a Buick Encore which I'm getting to like the more I see them. Have driven a couple of Trax's at work and liked the whole concept...just wish my seat time behind the wheel wasn't so brief each time. A big reason I enjoyed driving those rental vehicles around the state of Florida was the extended street time I got in them. Being in the market at the time, I learned first hand, and very quickly, what vehicles I would have on my short list and which ones I'd never ever consider.

Maybe $2500-$3k on the Honda.

As for taxes, in PA, you pay tax on the monthly payment. You would get no benefit on tax by turning in your current lease but you would if you trade in your other vehicles, per the PA laws I am reading online. So, for example, if you'd normally have a payment of $500 on a lease, you'd add the 8% PA tax for a total payment of $540. However, if you trade in and get your payment to $200, then you'd pay $216 with the tax, saving you $24/mo in tax. I'm simplifying it, but I think you get the idea.

I should also point out that you don't have to apply your trade-in value toward the lease payment to get your taxes reduced. Taking the example above, even if you trade and have them cut you a check rather than apply it to your payment, you'd have a $516 payment rather than the $540 payment because the tax benefit still applies.","Q--can you give me an approx. *retail* value on a 2004 Honda S2000, 70K miles, super clean, San Rafael, CA 94901?

I wasn't quite as keen on the car until I started researching. Places like Top Gear, Car and Driver, and various YouTube venues match the S2000 against the Porsche Boxster, BMW Z4, Audi TT, Nissan 350Z, and it comes out on top most of the time."

162,"""Everybody knows that buying used will save you money.""

That's one group of people who buy these cars used.

And then there are the payment buyers who don't mind setting up payments that last until the car is 10 years old.

Funny, nobody ""in their right mind"" will set up a 120-month term from new.
Given a choice, I'd rather do THAT than buy a 5 year old Tacoma and then go 60 months.

Nobody bats an eye when used cars are financed until whenever.","I am guilty of financing used cars that way. Funny thing is, very often, I am rightside up sooner in such cases than if I bought new. For example, buy 3-4 year old car on a 4-5 year note and be rightside up in 2.5-3 yrs vs finance new for 6 years and take 4-4.5 to be positive equity. Sure, the used car is effectively 6 yrs old vs the new car at 4 yrs old, but to a chronic payment buyer, that's not largely relevant. 

Of course, I have had many exceptions, too, such as the new Mustang that was breakeven at 18 mos into a 66-mo loan.",breakeven is easy. If you put down enough money at the beginning.,"It seems recently that cars are holding their values very well.  Let's take a new car with a poor residual like a Jeep Grand Cherokee.  You pay $40K plus tax for a 2016 that stickers for $47K.  They discount the day lights out of these.  Chrysler's stated residual for a 36 month lease hovers around the 50% mark.  You finance for $709 per month including tax for 60 months.  After 2 1/2 years, you think that jeep will be worth less than 20K?

Then take a 3 year old, off lease, GC.  You pay $26K plus tax.  You take out a 5 year loan at $460 per month.  I guess you are correct @qbrozen.  You should break even on the used car loan around the 2 year mark because depreciation slows after the car is 3 years old.

so after 2 1/2 years, you still owe $20K on the new Jeep.  After 2 years, you only owe $15K on the used Jeep.","
I put nothing down on the Mustang. Even rolled an extended warranty into the loan.

Oh, and the Honda Fit. That wasn't TOO bad. I put down $3k, got a 66-mo note, drove it for 14 mos, and got a check for $650 when I sold it to Carsense.

We also broke even on our 2003 Pilot we bought new. Very little discount, as they were just introduced. We had that for 24 mos and I believe we even rolled a couple grand negative equity into it on a 72-mo loan. But we know Hondas are largely silly resale.

I usually don't put much down on cars because the loan rates are so low.","@qbrozen - at almost 5 years old, I'm amazed at how well my wife's Pilot has held its value.

""Past performance is no guarantee of future results.""

That old axiom will probably prove true here.
Five years ago, not a lot of new cars were bought, so used cars from that era are relatively scarce.

At the moment, car sales are booming, so I'd expect a softer market 5 years from now.

Any periods of low pricing should be viewed as temporary.

On the last day of February, I leased a bottom-feeder Chevy Cruze LS 6MT. The General had sent me a $2k bonus on top of the $1,300 of rebate money I had accumulated on the GM card. On top of the $3,400 lease support and who-knows-what-else, so it came to a pretty dandy lease payment. I'd shaken hands on $190/month, with taxes and plate, first payment waived, with the GM card money subtracted later. Two years, 20k miles.
I'm not into commitment.

Come to pick up the car, the payment should have been sign & drive, $44/month. Then things got hinky, and they wanted $70/month... then $52/month... something about how I owed extra taxes if I put the GM card money down up front.
I found, not for the first time, that I do not know how to argue in the face of arguments that make no sense. So I did the math for them as 23 x 190 - 3,3320 is 1050 or some such, and they let me pay it all up front. So far so good.

But it did nickel and dime me (oh, how I wish it were real nickels and dimes) until about two years ago, when I finally exhausted, or should I say, exorcised, its demons. Now it's been an angel, you know, like that kid in the Twilight Zone who eventually kills his parents?

Short answer--when BMW built the early Minis, they were kind enough to let their customers do the R&D for them. But it was FUN to drive. It never let down in that capacity, and the early supercharged cars are still among the most fun to drive in the subcompact category.

Now how do I get paid for saying that?","I test drove a Mini S when they very first came out. It was quite the hoot. But kinda on the small side with 2 kids!

5K? I would just keep walking on by. But that's just me.

I just saw that my local guy got a pretty sounding Boxster S in. a 2005, with only 26K miles on it. Midnight blue over terracotta. Sounds gorgeous. Got listed as sale pending before the pictures even got up, so I guess will never see what it looks like.

I think it was list at about $22k. And no clue if the IMS repair was done!","Well if the IMS wasn't done, then he's pointing a revolver with one bullet in it at his head, sad to say. Click away.

Ironically, the lower the miles, the greater the risk. Best to just have it done now for $3500, for peace of mind.",You'd walk at $5K? But....but....you haven't even SEEN this beauty (it's very nice). I mean....$5K? You can't even buy a used Kia Rio for that! Have mercy.,"assuming that the IMS was done (and done right), what would be real world value on something like this? Just curious, since I really have no idea.","I'll give you $2,800 cash for the Mini. But you have to deliver it. to NJ.","Well I don't know, that's 3,000 miles out of my way....","
A 2005 Boxster S with say 75,000 miles and IMS bearing done should retail around $15,000. I'm not sure extra low miles would add much because they made a boatload of Boxsters and a buyer has an abundance to choose from in every color and configuration. Fun car to drive though, if you aren't too tall. Aside from IMS you also have to worry about head gasket problems and rear main seal leaks. This was not a good engine design.

Too bad I can't fit in a Miata (outside of the newest iteration). At least those are reliable!

A Z4 might be fun too. Though I think a 4 seat convertible of some kind makes more sense if I decide to get a drop top.","This is a dealer friend of mine who is selling a super nice E320 convertible. A tad pricey, though--but very low miles and complete service records.

I'll give you the Grand Caravan in exchange or, failing that, I'll drive you to the airport in El Paso (or you can visit your relations on the way down).","If I had a dream about myself driving a Grand Caravan, I'd probably wake up screaming. I would swap for a good running Triumph motorcycle however.","Ah, but you could carry the bike home in the back of the van.","I got me a pick-me-up already, remember? That Dodge Dakota turned out to be a real sweetheart---no problems after my initial once-over.","You'd expose a nice Triumph to rain and hail and theft hauling it in the back of a pickup? And that liftover height, ouch.

Shameful.","I live in California---we don't have rain and hail, and I'll be home in 16 hours.","



Color preference is so subjective! Stickguy likes the color of that E 320 but I think it really hurts the car. It's a love it or hate it color that (in my opinion) would turn off a lot of would be buyers.

And, it's spent time in Hawaii too so I would be watchful of corrosion. I grew up on the coast in So. Calif and cars never rusted. We would get pitted chrome but never rust. In Hawaii, especially on Maui it's a different story. The combination of the humidity and salt air can cause problems. I would want to get that Benz up on a rack for a look see.","I was thinking about $5K for the MINI S, as well.. $4900 asking and let it go for anything at $4500 or above.","I know this is a tough audience but when people see the car, most seem to think that price is quite fair for what you get. I mean, how many super-shiny, charming, insufferably cute, media-darling, fun-to-drive cars can you buy for that $4900 chump change? What? A clapped out Miata with 365,000 miles on it?

'04 Pathfinder SE 4x4 with alotta miles. They might throw $1k at it. Maybe up to $1500 just to make a deal happen.

That '13 Altima really should be pulling more considering the tires and reported condition. Although if the windshield truly needs to be replaced (rather than repaired), then that might explain it. If it weren't for that, I would peg it at $9500-$10k trade. There are plenty of rough ones out there from the rental companies for less, but you get what you pay for.

'14 Avalon should be around $23k-$24k. Most companies forgive minor door dings and wheel rash. Check your contract. Some companies even spell it out such as ""any cosmetic repairs under $500"" or something like that.

2wd Sequoia? $4500-$5k.

Mini - I think most dealers would have to be asking $6495-$6995 on such a vehicle (~$3500 auction price), so considering your stack of receipts and options and color combo, I'd probably be bold at $5495-$5995 for starters.

I believe that's called a buy bid. Many dealers in my area have signs out front saying they buy cars. Some even say they will beat carmax offers.","

We're talking about the 98 DeVille with 115k miles, correct? Having bought and sold a number of Cadillac DeVilles, I would have to agree. $5k would be a ""home run"" for sure (very unlikely to happen, but anything is possible). I actually doubt you could sell it quickly for more than $2 to $2.5. This car is too old, upkeep is expensive, no way I would touch that car.

Strictly out of curiosity, what was meant by ""the Northstar issues have been resolved"". There are basically 2 issues with the Northstar. Number one, and far more serious, are the headgaskets. Repairing the headgaskets properly (using studs) runs about $3k minimum. The dealer will charge you over $4k to use inserts, which are not as reliable as going aftermarket with the studs.

The number two issues with the Northstar are the oil leaks. That repair also runs more than the car is worth, but most people can safely ignore that. The car keeps running, you just get oil spots on your driveway or garage floor."

Exterior: Gray
Interior: Black Leather
Residual: $26,733.00
Payoff: $27,468.59
Condition: Clean/Good. The only interior issue is a small fabric flaw in the headliner fabric above the driver's door where my glasses (on top of my head) caught and snagged. It's very small and I'm not sure of how noticeable to others but my eyes are always drawn to it. It also has two or three door dings and a tiny bit of curb rash on one wheel. It also needs tires.

Basically, I am trying to figure out if it would be better financially to trade in my Avalon on something else and pay any negative equity up front (I don't want to roll it in) and start fresh. Or, should I ride out the remainder of my lease, in which case I'll probably be about 2500 miles over, and I'll have to pay to repair the door dings, wheel and purchase tires.

If I were to trade it in, the dealer would be stuck with it for who knows how long. They would have to find a place to store it while it declines in value and deteriorates in some storage lot.

The Honda store where I worked currently has a dozen or more nice used cars taken in trade that they can't sell.

Our CRV was also recalled for the airbag situation. I called them, three days later the car was fixed and I returned the loaner they let me use. I heard that Honda is putting people in long term loaners at no charge while parts arrive. Toyota flatly refused to do this for me!

So, suppose I decide to trade in the Avalon? Assuming the store has room to store it, how would they place a value on it?

I bought the S4 new in northern IL in September 2014. I had surgery in October and didn't drive it much (anfd I still had another car for highway/construction zone duty). On the Friday before Thanksgiving week, I took the Audi to work and crossed the 1000 mile break-in period on the way to my office.

Leaving work, I exited a busy highway and got into the right turn lane at the end of the ramp. Cars were making right turns on red one at a time and eventually I pulled up the front of the line. I think the punks behind me in their parent's newer Volvo S60 weren't paying attention, saw cars pulling onto the surface street and the driver floored it (they assumed the light went green). Too late they saw me stopped, swerved but rammed their front passenger corner into the rear driver corner on my S4. I was totally unhurt but VERY shaken up and upset. The punks (4 guys, maybe late high school or college aged) came along side and one said something about us both pulling over on the main road. I finish my right turn, and start looking for a shoulder (there was none) and drive about 1/2 mile down to a side street. As I near that road, I look around and realize the Volvo IS GONE!! After pulling along side to talk, it passed me & I'd noticed that it had out of state plates (Wisconsin Packer tags) but I missed the number - dangit!! I call for the police and get an accident report - but there's not much he can do.

I get an initial estimate, and after teardown the estimator calls me to tell me that the collision damaged the side and rear frames and crumpled the underside of the trunk. His guess is the cost to repair will be around $20,000 and declares it a total loss. From what I remember, he bases the totalling on the severity of the damage, it being virtually new and my having ""Keeper"" coverage on my Country policy that will repay me the price of a replacement S4. I was still in shock: my first new car in ~ 10 years, my first Audi, my first hit and run and now.... a big check to cover it. I was/am pretty mad at the guys in that car - these jerks probably went home and told mommy that they didn't know what happened to her S60 instead of taking any responsibility.

I've google'd the VIN a few times and have seen it for sale in Ohio with similar verbiages (about it having been a ""minor"" collision) and just laugh about the lies. Which also reminds me to skip salvage titled cars too....

And I bought a dashcam for my other car shortly after this. I'd always been meaning to, but my S4 experience made me wish I'd done it sooner.",Scary story. But at least (and it isn't usually this way) sounds like you didn't come out on the short end of the stick.,"
How is it possible 20K totals a $60K car (if it is true it is loaded as the seller says)? Something is missing here. You did mention frame damage, but still, never heard of a 33% of value repair being called a total. Usually it's around 80%.","And that, in a nutshell, is why I will never buy a Salvage title car...","Glad everyone enjoyed that story as much as I did. I've seen this ad for quite awhile and the description used to be far worse. Originally it just said the part about being ""like new and oh btw it has a salvage title but no big deal it was just a bumper replaced"". I assumed it had to have unibody damage to total it out.

Thanks for the pricing info. Those were both higher than I expected based on asking prices I'm seeing. How about one more?

Well perhaps such a minor accident is a detriment to a dealer's used car manager because people generally mistrust used car managers. But with a private party, and given your straightforward explanation, I don't think any rational person would care one bit if a rear bumper had been repainted on an 8 year old car.","
varies based on condition. A couple of super clean ones hit $22k, while the run-of-the-mill examples were $20k.","
The estimator told me it was being totalled based on frame damage (and safety of it after repairing), the newness of the vehicle and my full coverage. I also think he didn't like the shop I took the car to and didn't want to deal with them. I was as shocked as you... I've had $12K damage done to a $18K car and it was repaired.

I also wonder that since it was my insurance covering the car, they are more likely to ""do the right thing."" In that $12K/$18K crash, it was the other driver's fault and his insurance covered the repairs.

I looked a little closer to the pics from Autotrader and those are not the wheels that came with my car... mine were 18"" and those are 19"" wheels (or copies) from the Black Optic package. Here are pictures from the salvage yard: http://www.copart.com/us/Lot/34744894/Photos?SearchId=1189574770","
Thanks. That seems like the better buy than the Accord or Max.","
Now I'm curious if you or anyone else knows what the salvage yard/insurance company got for the damaged S4? I wonder how much they paid for it, and are now trying to unload it.

Maybe I should start a collection of accident damaged Misano red S4's.","
That's a rather subtle red; it's very difficult to see!","No idea what Copart got for ""my"" Audi - my involvement ended when I had to drop off some documents at their facility. I think the auction had an asking price (or starting bid?) in the upper $30's","

Haha, yeah. I can see this going from a Cooper to a Cooper S (probably not a JCW given the price increase vs. performance improvements), then maybe a Clubman before moving on from the brand.","
Notfast, it is great that you were willing to share the back story on the S4; it isn't often that we get to hear details like that when cars with this sort of ""questionable"" description come along. Thank you!","
I wouldn't disagree.","Looking for some advice or help on a possible trade. I'm considering a used '15 Challenger SRT with 2500 miles and it is totally loaded. VIN: 2C3CDZDJ2FH892852. I've noticed on CarGurus they don't seem to move very fast and can sit for 70 days and longer. But they all seem to start at $45k and higher. After 70-100 days they are down to 40k at a few dealers. Does this indicate the wholesale value is around 37-38k? I have a clean titled '14 Challenger R/T+, 11k miles, roof, nav, leather, auto, with numerous mods and immaculate to trade. Is a trade difference of 11-13k duable? I'm in MO and the 15 is 250 miles away.

Thanks for the help!","so i googled it and found a white one with manual transmission and manual trans in Little Rock. Yes?

These vary quite widely. About half come through in poor condition, interestingly enough. I guess they are a source of abuse. My only real comp was one in decent condition, 2300 miles, and manual trans, BUT It was grey. That got $41,000. They might let it go for $43k in a worst-case scenario.

Your target is nowhere near possible. You might be $24k-$25k on yours. There is a HUGE difference for the market between a standard RT and an SRT392.

The reason some are dropping the way you see them is probably because those are the poor condition ones I'm seeing. There are several down in the mid $30s range.","I'm in a bit of a pickle and desperately need some help. I live in southern CA and debating on trading in or returning my lease to the dealer. It's a bit complicated though... I have vandalism damage ($2,200) from keyed scratch all along the entire passenger side. My insurance deductible is $1,000, though the bodyshop says they'll help me a bit to reduce my payment to $750.
2013 Toyota Prius 3 (backup camera, navigation)

- 9/10 condition, other than paint damage
- silver paint

All dealers say repairing the damage won't improve their offer. One dealer tells me they'd rather have their qualified body shop repair than to have it show up on Carfax. Is this true and would this be the case if I decide to return the lease? Meaning... will Toyota charge additional fees because there was an insurance claim?

My lease residual is $15,700.
$300 disposition fee
$1,800 excess mileage (12K miles over)
$750 insurance deductible
Total $2,850 needed to return my lease. The trade-in breaking point is $12,850 so I wouldn't have to pay out of pocket. I know it's the least ideal solution of rolling that over into the next car... but I've been unemployed for 6 months and had to resort to Uber/Lyft driving to keep the bills paid.

Thank you so much in advance!!!",">> $1,800 excess mileage (12K miles over)

If you're paying 15 cents a mile, rejoice.

It's not going to get a lot cheaper, no matter what you drive. Why not ride out the lease, hope nothing breaks -- a solid bet on a Prius -- and then figure something else out?

That way you're guaranteed a ""trade-in value"" equal to the residual number, body work be damned.To my mind,this is the biggest advantage of leasing -- loss of value is not my problem.

Good on ya for talking to dealers before having the car repaired. It's good to have options, and I understand where they're coming from with the carfax.

Good luck,

Thank you for responding and your input!

Yes it is in Little Rock at a Infiniti Dealership but it is an auto.

Yes they are high performance cars, so a lot will have drag track wear. Which is why I was after a very low mileage one.

I think the ones I have seen drop to 40k and below have been there close to 100 days. I found one with 1000 miles @41.5 and when I sent them an email they came back with 40.5. When I responded back it was sold and it was almost identical to the white one.

From Edmonds I think they show trade in for the white one around 39.8. So wouldn't wholesale be at least 1k lower? And I think Edmonds had my car trade in @ 26+.

I'm going to wait to check on wh. one until it hits 60 days on lot. Thanks again!","trade-in is typically $1k below auction value, so Edmunds actually got the SRT correct. Yours is about $25.5k-$26k at auction, hence me pegging it where I did.

The site I found it on said manual. Just checked again and found a pic. Definitely an auto. Doesn't seem to change the value, though.",Q....why is there a difference between trade-in value and auction value? I would think that most of the stats for trade-in value we see online come from auction results. ,"I think it is to protect themselves in case they need to send it to auction or wholesale it. If a dealer pays you straight-up auction value, then they have no choice but to sell it themselves. If they are unsuccessful, then they have to pay transport and auction fees to recoup their investment, which would put them in the red on your particular car.

They will step up if they feel strongly enough that they'll have no problem retailing your trade or if they really want to get the deal done. It is why Carmax is often higher than a dealer... because Carmax is absolutely keeping it for themselves and you driving it to their door saves them auction fees and transport.

Similarly, they can go even lower if they are selling to a wholesaler. It adds yet another middleman to the process. They'll give you, let's say $1500 under auction, then sell it to the wholesaler for $1k under auction, and then the wholesaler either takes it to the block or sells it to another local used car dealer.",That makes a lot of sense---thanks!,"steine13 said:

I haven't spent much time entertaining the idea of keeping the Prius any longer than the lease because I can't wait to move on to the next car. It has been as reliable as can be, but also the most boring vehicle I've ever owned.
With that said, I don't like the idea of paying $16K for a car I don't want that carries a $10-13K value.","Complete shot in the dark, but I'm going to say the Prius would be worth $10k.","Is this a fair price from a Toyota dealer?

169,"I'm with Q on this---whatever the dealer says, say ""Fine"". The car owes you nothing. You could probably get a bit more on Craigslist but for cars in this price range, it's kinda dicey exposing yourself to the unique features of this particular market.","It's tax season, the car has leather (close enough), someone will pay $2900 for it, guaranteed.

What shifty says about the pain & suffering of dealing with the buyers is also correct.
Careful vetting over the phone helps, in my experience.

We never talked about the transmission that I could see -- if a stick and it good shape, I would consider it myself and certainly pay $2. The old rule of $0.10/mile -- will this car last another 20k miles without major expense?? -- applies here. There's no guarantee but if it's taken care of, there's a decent chance.

This kind of car, a factor of three between trade-in and retail sounds about right.

Just to close the loop here... as the resident cheapskate, i *am* still OK with a base vehicle.

In the interest of monthly-payment-golf -- or is that limbo? -- the final numbers worked out to sign & drive, $190/month, first payment made by GM, and then subtract the GM Card discount. It comes to $44/month. If I don't lease again or buy another GM product at turn-in, there's a turn-in fee that raises the total to $60/month. Merci, mon general!

I will report if/when the Subaru has sold.

That's cool.. I guess to get the true imputed value, you'd have to know how much you sacrificed over using a credit card with 1% cash back, over the time you accumulated your GM points.

Either way... really cheap",You are really tempting me to get one of these GM credit cards.,"2011 GTI. 52000 miles, automatic. In San Diego. Dealer asking $14,700. What's it worth?",Vin WVWFD7AJ6BW152346,"That's about normal dealer retail so maybe you can try 10-15% off that? BTW, I don't see it on the dealer's website inventory, so maybe it's gone?","
That's easy enough to figure out -- the $2k ""bonus rebate"" was just that, which leaves $1,332 of ""earned"" rebate at five percent.

This required me to give up 1/5 of that in credit card cash rebate, or $266.
I now have a two percent cash back from citi, so now it becomes $532 -- but that one is a recent development.

The thing with the GM Card is you never know the form of the rebate ... if you get ""topped off"", your earned rebate goes completely by the wayside. I try to max out the card every year mostly from habit; I've had it for 21 years now and it's helped me out quite a bit.

But the main thing is to have it so if they decide to give away some money... and since their various depts don't talk to each other... naturally... amazing deals can be had at odd intervals.

People pay more for old used up Honda's and Toyota's because of what real-world experience tells you. They are essentially bulletproof. Case in point, in '02 we bought a ten-year old '92 Civic Hatchback Auto DX model with 166K+ miles. It was reliable and fairly clean for its age and miles. Ran it for 2 years up to 200K miles, and sold it for only $800 less than we paid for it. Probably put in about a grand over that time with new brakes (rotors too; maintenance), new distributor (CEL light repair; unexpected), new instrument panel from a junk yard (speedo issues), and that's it. Good little car; very low cost/mile ratio.","
One Audi used car manager would disagree with you. My old A3 barely got hit on the rear bumper, requiring a simple repair and respray of the back bumper only ($667). It showed up on CarFax because it was the La Mesa PD that hit me and they reported it. Car was nearly 8 years old and 100K miles and they offered $6K.

Yes please share.

That's an extremely interesting ad as it's very similar to the S4 I'm stuck with only mine's got 43K miles and I actually love the car (but hate the accident history; luckily, mine's not salvaged).

Questions I'd pose to the seller:
1) if it's salvage, how can it be only the back bumper was damaged?
2) why don't you want to hear about unbiased KBB values?
3) I don't care if it was only the back bumper repainted; I'm deducting 20% off a clean car value in my offer.
4) Why are the pictures of 2 different cars? Different wheels when you show the back, vs. when you show the front.","
I can't see that far back, typically. With those miles, they are floating around $35k-$36k."
