       " Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store.  It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer.  It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing,  not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those.  Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).  To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone.                        </div>,\n",

So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly it seems like the incentives on the 2019s are less than what was available over the summer for the 2018s.

We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX.                         </div>,\n",

       "                             The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic \"button\" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time.<br/><br/>In terms of handling, even my wife has said she really likes the way the TLX drives. She likes the 4-wheel steering (although it took her a couple of months to actually feel it), the handling, and the smooth power.                         </div>,\n",
